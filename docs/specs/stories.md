# stories.md — project-guide (Python)

This document breaks the `project-guide` project into an ordered sequence of small, independently completable stories grouped into phases. Each story has a checklist of concrete tasks. Stories are organized by phase and reference modules defined in `tech-spec.md`.

Stories with code changes include a version number (e.g., v0.1.0). Stories with only documentation or polish changes omit the version number. The version follows semantic versioning and is bumped per story. Stories are marked with `[Planned]` initially and changed to `[Done]` when completed.

## Phase K: Release & Phase Lifecycle (v2.1.0)

Close the lifecycle gap so the next phase can start with a clean slate. Introduce `archive_stories` mode, codify the phase letter scheme and `## Future` section, teach `default` mode to suggest a next move when all stories are `[Done]`, and update `plan_phase` to continue phase letters across an archive boundary. See `phase-k-release-lifecycle-plan.md` for full details.

**Implementation strategy:** Spike first (K.a) with a throwaway script that exercises the full archive flow end-to-end — version derivation, file move, template re-render, `## Future` carry-over — before introducing the new `archive` action type or the productionized mode.

Out of scope (deferred to later phases): release/version-bump/tag automation (developer works across multiple git flows and prefers tool-agnostic), `code_production` mode and `code_*` abstraction, audit modes.

### Story K.a: v2.1.0 End-to-End Spike — archive_stories Flow [Planned]

Wire the full archive pipeline end-to-end as a throwaway script in `scripts/`, before any productionized mode template, metadata entry, or new action type. Validates the critical path: detect latest version from a fixture `stories.md`, detect latest phase letter, move to `.archive/stories-vX.Y.Z.md`, re-render an empty `stories.md` with the carried-over `## Future` section.

- [ ] Create `scripts/spike_archive_stories.py` (throwaway, not part of the package)
- [ ] Implement latest-version detection by scanning `stories.md` for `v\d+\.\d+\.\d+` story headings
- [ ] Implement latest-phase-letter detection by scanning `## Phase <Letter>:` headings
- [ ] Implement `## Future` section extraction (everything from `## Future` to EOF)
- [ ] Implement archive move: create `.archive/` if missing, move `stories.md` → `.archive/stories-vX.Y.Z.md`
- [ ] Implement fresh `stories.md` re-render from the artifact template with the extracted `## Future` content re-injected
- [ ] Run against a fixture `stories.md` (copy of pre-archive Phase J file) and verify round-trip
- [ ] Verify: archived file matches original; new `stories.md` is empty body + carried `## Future`
- [ ] Document spike findings in the story's commit message (decisions to carry into K.c/K.d)

### Story K.b: v2.1.1 Codify Phase Letter Scheme and Future Section [Planned]

Move the phase letter rules into a shared include and codify the `## Future` section in the stories artifact template so both planning and post-archive flows reference one source.

- [ ] Create `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/_phase-letters.md` shared include
  - [ ] Document phase letter scheme: `A`–`Z`, then `AA`, `AB`, …, `AZ`, `BA`, … (base-26, no zero)
  - [ ] Document story sub-letter scheme: `A.a`–`A.z`, then `A.aa`, `A.ab`, …
  - [ ] Note that letters continue across archive boundaries (read `.archive/` to find the latest)
- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/stories.md` to include a `## Future` section after `{{ phases_and_stories }}`
  - [ ] Add a brief inline note describing what belongs there (deferred stories, future phases, project-level out-of-scope items)
- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/plan-stories-mode.md` to include `_phase-letters.md`
- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/plan-phase-mode.md` to include `_phase-letters.md`
- [ ] Verify: rendered `default` mode and `plan_phase` mode both contain the phase letter rules exactly once
- [ ] Add tests for the updated `stories.md` artifact template (renders with empty and populated `## Future`)

### Story K.c: v2.1.2 Archive Action Type [Planned]

Add a new `archive` action type to the metadata schema and action handler. Carries the version-derivation and move-and-recreate semantics validated in K.a.

- [ ] Extend `project_guide/metadata.py` to recognize `action: archive` on artifacts
- [ ] Implement archive action semantics: derive version from latest story in source file, move to `<dirname>/.archive/<basename>-vX.Y.Z.md`, re-render fresh artifact preserving `## Future`
- [ ] Add validation: `archive` action requires the source file to exist
- [ ] Unit tests for version derivation (single story, multiple stories, no versioned stories)
- [ ] Unit tests for phase letter derivation (single phase, multiple phases, post-Z letters)
- [ ] Unit tests for `## Future` extraction and re-injection (present, absent, empty)
- [ ] Unit tests for the archive action against a fixture `stories.md`
- [ ] Verify: existing `create` and `modify` action types still work unchanged

### Story K.d: v2.1.3 archive_stories Mode [Planned]

Productionize the `archive_stories` mode using the `archive` action type and `_phase-letters.md` include from prior stories.

- [ ] Create `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/archive-stories-mode.md` (sequence-style, uses `_header-sequence.md`)
- [ ] Mode steps: read `stories.md`, warn if any non-`[Done]` stories, show planned archive path, await confirmation, perform archive, suggest `plan_phase`
- [ ] Add `archive_stories` entry to `project_guide/templates/project-guide/.metadata.yml` under the `# Post-Release` section with `action: archive` on `stories.md` and `next_mode: plan_phase`
- [ ] Integration test: render `archive_stories` mode, execute against a fixture, verify the archived file and the fresh `stories.md`
- [ ] Delete `scripts/spike_archive_stories.py` (now superseded)
- [ ] Verify: `project-guide mode archive_stories` works end-to-end on a clean test project

### Story K.e: v2.1.4 plan_phase Post-Archive Support [Planned]

Update `plan_phase` to handle an empty `stories.md` and continue phase letters from `.archive/` when present.

- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/plan-phase-mode.md` to handle the empty-`stories.md` case explicitly
- [ ] Document the `.archive/` lookup: read `.archive/stories-vX.Y.Z.md` (latest by version) and parse the highest phase letter to determine the next letter
- [ ] Reference `_phase-letters.md` for the letter rules rather than restating them
- [ ] Add a fixture test: empty `stories.md` + `.archive/stories-v2.0.20.md` containing Phase J → next phase letter is `K`
- [ ] Add a fixture test: empty `stories.md` + no `.archive/` → next phase letter is `A`
- [ ] Verify: rendered `plan_phase` mode correctly references the include and the archive lookup

### Story K.f: v2.1.5 Default Mode All-Stories-Done Suggestion [Planned]

Teach `default` mode to detect when all stories are `[Done]` and prompt the developer to choose between `archive_stories` and `plan_phase`.

- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/default-mode.md` with an "If all stories are [Done]" section
- [ ] Detection performed by the LLM at read time (consistent with v2 architecture — no Python-side check)
- [ ] Prompt suggests both `archive_stories` (clean slate first) and `plan_phase` (plan against history first), explaining the trade-off
- [ ] If at least one story is non-`[Done]`, the existing default lifecycle suggestions apply unchanged
- [ ] Verify by manually rendering `default` mode against (a) a fresh project, (b) an in-progress project, (c) a fully-`[Done]` project

### Story K.g: v2.1.6 Phase K Documentation and CHANGELOG [Planned]

- [ ] Add `archive_stories` to the modes catalogue (whichever source doc lists modes — confirm location during the story; do not edit `docs/project-guide/` since it is the installed copy)
- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/default-mode.md` "All Available Modes" table with the new mode under Post-Release
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with v2.1.0–v2.1.5 entries
- [ ] Update README if any user-facing wording references the lifecycle workflow
- [ ] Verify: `project-guide mode archive_stories` appears in `project-guide --help` mode list (if applicable)

### Story K.h: v2.1.7 project-essentials.md Placeholder and Render Hook [Planned]

Establish a per-project `project-essentials.md` artifact that gets injected into every rendered mode via `_header-common.md`. This is the minimal hookup — empty/missing renders cleanly, content (when present) appears as a `## Project Essentials` section in every mode. Phase L will wire the planning modes to populate it; this story just lays the rails and dogfoods it for this project. See `phase-l-project-essentials-plan.md` for the follow-up phase.

- [ ] Create `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/project-essentials.md`
  - [ ] Empty body with a brief comment block describing what belongs there: workflow rules, architecture quirks, domain conventions, hidden coupling, dogfooding/meta notes
  - [ ] Note that an empty file is acceptable
- [ ] Update `project_guide/render.py` to read `<spec_artifacts_path>/project-essentials.md` if present
  - [ ] Pass content as the `project_essentials` Jinja2 context variable
  - [ ] Default to empty string when the file is missing or empty (no error)
- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/_header-common.md`
  - [ ] After the **Rules** section and before the `# {{ mode_name }} mode` heading, render `{% if project_essentials %}## Project Essentials\n\n{{ project_essentials }}\n\n---\n{% endif %}` (or equivalent — section omitted entirely when empty)
- [ ] Tests in `tests/test_render.py`:
  - [ ] Rendered output contains `## Project Essentials` when fixture file is non-empty
  - [ ] Rendered output omits the section when fixture file is empty
  - [ ] Rendered output omits the section when fixture file is missing (no error)
  - [ ] **Regression guard**: rendered output never contains the literal string `{{ project_essentials }}` in any of the above cases. This catches a future template edit that removes the `{% if %}` guard, since `_LenientUndefined.__str__` would otherwise render the placeholder verbatim. See `render.py:83-99`.
- [ ] Populate `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` for this project with current must-know facts:
  - [ ] Dogfooding rule: edit templates under `project_guide/templates/project-guide/`, never `docs/project-guide/` (the installed copy)
  - [ ] Workflow rule: prefix Python tools with `pyve run` (e.g., `pyve run pytest`, `pyve run ruff check`)
  - [ ] `docs/project-guide/go.md` is dynamically re-rendered by the `mode` command — never hand-edit
  - [ ] (Add others if any surface during the story)
- [ ] Verify by running `project-guide mode default` (or any mode) and inspecting `docs/project-guide/go.md` for the rendered Project Essentials section
- [ ] Note: do **not** add `project-essentials.md` as a tracked artifact in any mode's `.metadata.yml` entry yet — that wiring is Phase L's responsibility

### Story K.i: v2.1.8 Render Output Validation — Fail on Unrendered Placeholders [Planned]

Generalize the K.h `{{ project_essentials }}` regression guard into a project-wide safeguard. After every render, scan the output for any remaining `{{ identifier }}` Jinja-style placeholders. If any are found, raise `RenderError` with the placeholder names. This catches missed intents (a context variable that should have been set), typos (`{{ project_essentialss }}`), and removed `{% if %}` guards across **all** templates, not just `_header-common.md`. The current `_LenientUndefined` class (`render.py:83-99`) outputs `{{ var_name }}` for undefined variables — this story turns that observation into a hard error gate. Lenient mode itself stays unchanged because its placeholder output is what makes the validator's job possible.

- [ ] Add a post-render validation function in `project_guide/render.py`
  - [ ] Regex: `\{\{\s*[a-zA-Z_]\w*\s*\}\}` (matches `{{var}}`, `{{ var }}`, `{{  var  }}`)
  - [ ] Scan the rendered string after Jinja produces output, before writing the file
  - [ ] If matches found, raise `RenderError` with the list of placeholder names and a hint message: "Check (1) render.py context variables and (2) template variable spellings"
- [ ] Call the validator inside `render_go_project_guide` after `template.render(...)` but before `output_path.write_text(...)`
- [ ] Tests in `tests/test_render.py`:
  - [ ] Rendering a template that references an undefined variable raises `RenderError`
  - [ ] Error message includes the offending placeholder name
  - [ ] Rendering with all variables defined succeeds (existing parametrized mode test should still pass)
  - [ ] Validator does not raise on templates with no Jinja variables at all
- [ ] Remove the now-redundant `{{ project_essentials }}` regression-guard assertion added in K.h (the generalized validator subsumes it). Leave a brief comment in the test file noting the validator covers this case.
- [ ] Audit existing mode templates and `_header-common.md` to confirm none rely on undefined variables silently passing through. Fix any that do.
- [ ] Verify: running `project-guide mode default` and `project-guide mode plan_concept` still produces valid `go.md` output with no errors
- [ ] Document the limitation in a code comment: templates that legitimately want to emit literal `{{ var }}` strings (e.g., documentation of Jinja syntax) will trigger false positives. Not currently a problem; bridge if/when needed.

## Phase L: Project Essentials Integration (v2.2.0)

Wire the three planning modes (`plan_tech_spec`, `refactor_plan`, `plan_phase`) to populate and maintain `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` so that new and existing projects automatically capture must-know facts that future LLMs need to avoid blunders. Phase K (story K.h) established the placeholder, render hook, and dogfooded the artifact for this project. Phase L makes it self-maintaining across the planning lifecycle. See `phase-l-project-essentials-plan.md` for full details.

**Implementation strategy:** No spike — the integration boundary (LLM context variable) was already validated in K.h. Each mode update is independent and small; they could ship in any order, but the listed order matches the project lifecycle (initial → refactor → per-phase).

Out of scope (deferred or already covered): a dedicated `refactor_essentials` mode (not needed; the three planning modes cover the lifecycle), a new `create_or_modify` action type (the mode templates handle existence-checking conversationally instead).

### Story L.a: v2.2.0 plan_tech_spec Populates project-essentials.md [Planned]

After the tech-spec is approved, prompt the developer to capture any project-specific must-know facts and write them to `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`.

- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/plan-tech-spec-mode.md` to add a final step after tech-spec approval
- [ ] Step asks the developer for project-essentials content with concrete examples in the prompt:
  - Workflow rules (e.g., tool wrappers, virtual env conventions)
  - Architecture quirks (e.g., source vs generated/installed file locations)
  - Domain conventions (e.g., money in cents, dates in UTC)
  - Hidden coupling (e.g., auto-generated files, regenerated outputs)
  - Skip if there are none — empty is fine
- [ ] Generate `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` from the artifact template only if the developer provides facts; otherwise leave the file empty (or skip creation entirely)
- [ ] Add `project-essentials.md` to `plan_tech_spec`'s `artifacts` list in `project_guide/templates/project-guide/.metadata.yml` with `action: create`
- [ ] Tests for the rendered mode template containing the new prompt
- [ ] Verify: running `project-guide mode plan_tech_spec` end-to-end on a fixture project includes the essentials prompt

### Story L.b: v2.2.1 refactor_plan Refreshes project-essentials.md [Planned]

When `refactor_plan` updates the concept/features/tech-spec, give the developer a chance to refresh `project-essentials.md` for any architecture or workflow changes that affect must-know facts.

- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/refactor-plan-mode.md` to add a cycle step (or extend Step 1) for revisiting project-essentials
- [ ] Prompt: "Did any of these refactor changes affect facts that future LLMs must know? (e.g., new tool wrapper, renamed module, changed conventions). Update project-essentials.md if so."
- [ ] Mode template handles the case where `project-essentials.md` does not yet exist (legacy project): create from artifact template, then populate
- [ ] Mode template handles the case where it exists: read, modify, write
- [ ] Add `project-essentials.md` to `refactor_plan`'s `artifacts` list in `.metadata.yml` with `action: modify`
- [ ] Tests for the rendered mode template
- [ ] Verify: rendered `refactor_plan` mode includes the revisit step

### Story L.c: v2.2.2 plan_phase Appends to project-essentials.md [Planned]

When `plan_phase` plans a new phase, prompt the developer to append any new must-know facts the phase introduces.

- [ ] Update `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/plan-phase-mode.md` to add a step after phase approval
- [ ] Prompt: "Does this phase introduce any new must-know facts that should be added to project-essentials.md? (e.g., new architecture, new workflow rule, new gotcha)"
- [ ] Append (do not overwrite) to `project-essentials.md` if the developer provides facts
- [ ] Mode template handles the create case for legacy projects (file does not yet exist)
- [ ] Add `project-essentials.md` to `plan_phase`'s `artifacts` list in `.metadata.yml` with `action: modify`
- [ ] Tests for the rendered mode template
- [ ] Verify: rendered `plan_phase` mode includes the append prompt

### Story L.d: v2.2.3 Phase L Documentation and CHANGELOG [Planned]

- [ ] Add `project-essentials.md` to the artifacts catalogue (wherever artifacts are listed in `project_guide/templates/project-guide/`)
- [ ] Cross-reference `project-essentials.md` from `concept.md`, `features.md`, and/or `tech-spec.md` artifact templates if appropriate (a one-line "see also")
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with v2.2.0–v2.2.2 entries
- [ ] Update README if any user-facing wording references the new artifact
- [ ] Verify by running each of the three updated planning modes against a fresh fixture project

## Future

### Future Story: Test First flag [Deferred]

Add a `--test-first` flag to the `init` command that causes coding to prefer `code_test_first` whenever `code_velocity` would have been chosen as a next step. This involves abstracting out the `code_*` mode and paves the way for a future `code_production` mode.

### Future Story: Code Production Mode [Deferred]

Implement the `code_production` mode...TBD

### Future Story: Audit Modes [Deferred]

Future modes (deferred): `audit_security`, `audit_architecture`, `audit_performance`, `audit_best_practices`, `audit_modularity`, `audit_patterns`

### Out of Scope for Phase J

- Mode auto-detection from `files_exist` prerequisites (future advanced feature)
- Interactive mode menu (deferred — direct `mode <name>` argument is sufficient for v2.0.0)
- LLM API calls for artifact generation (future — currently the LLM fills in variables conversationally)
- Per-project metadata overrides in `.project-guide.yml` (future — metadata.yml is the single source for now)
- Migration tooling for `docs/guides/` → `docs/project-guide/` (future `refactor` mode)
- Story detection in `status` command (nice-to-have, can be added in a follow-up phase)
- Future modes: `code_production`, `audit_*`, `refactor_*`
