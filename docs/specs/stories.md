# stories.md -- project-guide (python)

This document breaks the `project-guide` project into an ordered sequence of small, independently completable stories grouped into phases. Each story has a checklist of concrete tasks. Stories are organized by phase and reference modules defined in `tech-spec.md`.

Put **`vX.Y.Z` in the story title only when that story ships the package version bump** for that release. Doc-only or polish stories **omit the version from the title** (they share the release with the preceding code story, or use your project’s doc-release policy). **One semver bump per owning story** — extra tasks on the *same* story share that bump; see `project-essentials.md`. Semantic versioning applies to the package. Stories are marked with `[Planned]` initially and changed to `[Done]` when completed.

For a high-level concept (why), see [`concept.md`](concept.md). For requirements and behavior (what), see [`features.md`](features.md). For implementation details (how), see [`tech-spec.md`](tech-spec.md). For project-specific must-know facts, see [`project-essentials.md`](project-essentials.md) (`plan_phase` appends new facts per phase). For the workflow steps tailored to the current mode (cycle steps, approval gates, conventions), see [`docs/project-guide/go.md`](../project-guide/go.md) — re-read it whenever the mode changes or after context compaction.

## Version Cadence

Standard semantic versioning, with these conventions:

- **Every story belongs to a phase.** Bugfix stories included. No orphan stories.
- **Per-story bumping** (when a story owns its own release):
  - Bugfix or trivial change → **patch** (`vX.Y.Z+1`)
  - Feature or improvement → **minor** (`vX.Y+1.0`)
  - Breaking change → **major** (`vX+1.0.0`). Post-1.0 only, and only via the `plan_production_phase` mode, which negotiates with the developer about whether the breakage is substantively user-facing or technically-but-trivially breaking (example: a log-format change is technically breaking, but if logs aren't a core consumer capability, the developer may judge it minor or even patch).
- **Phase-bundling option:** a phase can run unversioned during work and ship a single release/tag at end-of-phase. Stories within the phase carry no version in their title; the phase's last story owns the bump (magnitude determined by the highest-impact change in the bundle).
- **No out-of-order implementation.** Story order in this file is the order of execution. If work order needs to change, **reorganize/renumber here first** — don't skip ahead and create version-number gaps.
- **Pre-1.0:** standard semver applies; version starts at `v0.1.0` (Story A.a).
- **Post-1.0:** every phase must go through `plan_production_phase` (the lighter `plan_phase` is pre-1.0 only). Major bumps only happen through that mode's negotiation step.

This is the authoritative cadence rule. **Do not extrapolate the bump magnitude from `pyproject.toml`'s current version** — re-read this section whenever you're about to assign a version to a story.

## Phase R: Quality of Life Improvements and Bug Fixes

---

### Story R.a: v2.18.1 Gitbetter `git-commit` subcommand [Done]

Gitbetter just added a `git-commit` subcommand to allow iterations on commits locally and then pushing a batch to GitHub, which will save substantially on GitHub Actions CI minutes. 

This new `project-guide git-commit` subcommand is nearly identical to its sibling `project-guide git-push`. From the Project Guide perspective, the two commands have the identical interface and behavior. 

- [x] Add `project-guide git-commit` subcommand that mirrors `project-guide git-push` functionality — both share `_run_gitbetter_wrapper(tool_name, …)` in `cli.py`
- [x] Update tests to cover the new command — 8 new `test_git_commit_*` tests (636 passed total)
- [x] Update documentation to reflect the new command — README, site commands.md, concept/features/tech-spec/project-essentials
- [x] Bump patch version to `v2.18.1` — `version.py`, `pyproject.toml`, CHANGELOG dated 2026-08-01

## Subphase R-1: Shell Completion Fixes

Shell completion is not working properly from a bare install. This needs to be corrected, as documented in `docs/specs/shell-completion-ownership.md`.

project-guide gains a `completion` command group and takes ownership of the protocol it generates, replacing the block pyve hand-writes into the user's rc file today. Full plan, decisions, and out-of-scope negotiation: [`phase-r-subphase-1-shell-completion-plan.md`](phase-r-subphase-1-shell-completion-plan.md). Ships as one bundled release, **`v2.19.0`** (Story R.i); stories before it run unversioned.

**Route decisions** (from the plan): **zsh** uses the fpath autoload file its `#compdef` script is built for; **bash** uses an rc-block eval, the only route available to it. Shell scope is zsh + bash — fish is deferred.

---

### Story R.b: Integration spike — off-`PATH` completion [Done]

**Spike — time-boxed, throwaway. The deliverable is a documented decision, not production code.**

Inspecting Click's generated scripts revealed that the change request's central claim — *"`--bin` is the whole of the interface"* — is incomplete. Every generated callback embeds the **bare command name** and resolves it through `PATH` **at completion time**, long after the rc block ran:

```zsh
(( ! $+commands[project-guide] )) && return 1
response=(... $(env COMP_WORDS=... _PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=zsh_complete project-guide))
```

Baking an absolute path into the rc block fixes only the *generation* call at shell startup. With the binary off `PATH`, zsh's `$+commands` guard returns empty before it even tries; bash's `$1` lookup fails equivalently. project-guide must therefore **post-process** Click's output rather than emit it verbatim — and that is unproven.

Everything downstream depends on the answer: if post-processing is infeasible, `--bin`'s contract with pyve changes and R.c–R.g are written differently.

- [x] Reproduce the failure: binary off `PATH`, completion installed by absolute path, confirm zsh and bash both yield nothing — zsh driven end-to-end through `zsh/zpty` with a real TAB; both shells yield nothing, bash additionally prints `env: project-guide: No such file or directory`
- [x] Prototype post-processing for zsh — substitute the absolute path, neutralize the `(( ! $+commands[...] ))` guard; confirm completion works off `PATH` — guard replaced with `[[ -x <bin> ]] || return 1`; 12 completions off `PATH`
- [x] Prototype the bash equivalent — substitute for `$1` in the `env ... $1` invocation — plus an **added** `[[ -x <bin> ]]` guard bash doesn't ship with (Amendment 2)
- [x] Determine whether post-processing must differ between the zsh fpath route and the bash rc route — it does not; Click's `loadautofunc` branch handles registration, so one generator serves both (Amendment 1)
- [x] Check whether Click's generated output is stable enough to post-process by pattern, or whether a version guard against the installed Click is needed — byte-identical across Click 8.1.8 → 8.4.0 (8.4.2 differs by one blank line); no version guard, assert each substitution matches exactly once instead
- [x] Write the outcome into the subphase plan as a **Spike result** section — the chosen approach, what was rejected, and any revision to `--bin`'s contract — [`phase-r-subphase-1-shell-completion-plan.md`](phase-r-subphase-1-shell-completion-plan.md) § "Spike result (Story R.b)"
- [x] Discard the prototype code — scratchpad only; nothing landed in the repo

**Outcome: post-processing is viable.** `--bin`'s contract with pyve holds, and R.c–R.i proceed as planned with four amendments recorded in the plan: (1) the transformation is route-independent; (2) bash needs an executable guard project-guide *adds*, or a stale install prints on every TAB; (3) post-process only when `--bin` is absolute, else emit Click's script verbatim; (4) macOS bash 3.2 registers **nothing** (`complete -o nosort` is bash ≥ 4.4), which is worse than the `compopt` limitation currently recorded as out of scope. No version bump — spike, no shipped code.

### Story R.c: `completion` command group scaffold + `show` [Done]

The read-only slice: everything needed to *produce* a correct script, with no filesystem writes. Establishes the group, shell detection, and the post-processing proven in R.b.

- [x] Add the `completion` Click group with `--shell auto|zsh|bash` resolution (`auto` reads `$SHELL`, falling back to an explicit error rather than a guess) — `resolve_shell` in the new `project_guide/completion.py`
- [x] Implement script generation via Click's `_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=<shell>_source` protocol — `generate_script` calls the protocol's `ShellComplete` class in-process (same template, no subprocess). The supported set is project-guide's, not Click's: fish is refused because the group cannot yet *install* what it would generate
- [x] Apply the R.b post-processing so the emitted script does not depend on `PATH` — one generator for both shells (R.b Amendment 1); each substitution must match **exactly once** or hard-error naming the failed pattern (no Click version guard, per the R.b stability finding) — `postprocess_script`; the callback is checked first so an unrecognizable script fails on the pattern both shells share
- [x] Implement `--bin` resolution: explicit flag → project-guide's own resolved absolute path → bare-name `PATH` fallback. Post-process **only** when the result is absolute; on the bare-name fallback emit Click's script verbatim (R.b Amendment 3 — the baked guard is a filesystem test) — `resolve_bin`; symlinks deliberately unresolved (the shim is the stable handle), and argv[0] is used only when it *is* the console script, so `python -m project_guide` falls through to the `PATH` lookup
- [x] `completion show` prints the post-processed script to stdout; no writes, no prompts
- [x] Tests: per-shell generation, `--bin` resolution order, `--shell auto` detection, unsupported-shell error — 48 new tests in `tests/test_completion.py` (684 passed total)
- [x] Verify `--quiet` / `--no-input` interaction is coherent for a stdout-producing command — **took neither flag** (`--quiet` would make the command a no-op; `--no-input` would imply a prompt that does not exist), and closed two stdout leaks the verification surfaced: the auto-heal hook's `Update?` confirm and the legacy-config `Migrated` notice both wrote to **stdout** ahead of every subcommand, so `eval "$(project-guide completion show)"` would have evaluated them as shell code. Both moved to stderr, matching the rest of the hook

End-to-end verified with the shipped code, binary off `PATH`: bash rc-eval yields 13 completions, zsh fpath autoload yields the full list under a real interactive shell.

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.d: `completion install` / `uninstall` — bash rc-block route [Done]

The rc-block writer and its sentinel machinery. This is the first project-guide code that writes **outside the project directory**, so the safety contract is the story.

- [x] Write a sentinel-bracketed block to the resolved rc file (`--rc` override; default `~/.bashrc`) — `SENTINEL_START` / `SENTINEL_END` (conda-style pair, the shape pyve's legacy block already uses) plus `build_block`, which stamps the generating version so an old block is identifiable on sight
- [x] Idempotent: re-running with an already-current block is a no-op — no write, no backup, reported as `RcOutcome.UNCHANGED`. An existing block is refreshed **where it sits** rather than moved to the tail, so a user who repositioned it keeps their layout
- [x] `uninstall` removes the block **byte-clean**, so `install` → `uninstall` round-trips the rc file exactly — including the blank separator line `install` inserted, which is reclaimed only when it is genuinely adjacent slack (block at EOF, or a second blank line follows), never a blank line structuring the user's own content
- [x] Ours-vs-foreign predicate: only project-guide's own sentinel is touched; foreign content under a similar header is left alone with a stderr warning (mirrors `_ensure_gitignore_entry()`) — `_foreign_warnings`; pyve's legacy block is reported and survives both `install` and `uninstall` untouched. Ours is installed **alongside** it, which is the duplicate-registration state R.g exists to resolve
- [x] Back up the rc file before first modification — `.bak.<timestamp>` beside the rc file, on every content-changing write (install *and* uninstall), skipped on the no-op path
- [x] Degrade silently at shell startup — a broken or stale block must never print. Also silent **at completion time**: the R.b Amendment 2 `[[ -x <bin> ]]` guard, or bash prints `env: …: No such file or directory` on every TAB against a stale `--bin` — nothing is *executed* at startup at all: the script is written **inline** rather than as an `eval "$(…)"`, so a stale install cannot print and no Python subprocess runs per shell start
- [x] Decide whether to strip `complete -o nosort` (bash ≥ 4.4) so completion registers at all on macOS system bash 3.2 — R.b Amendment 4; verified that stripping restores registration, at the cost of Click's unsorted ordering — **decided: neither strip nor keep, but fall back at runtime.** `apply_bash_compat` rewrites the line to `complete -o nosort -F … 2>/dev/null || complete -F …`, so bash ≥ 4.4 keeps Click's ordering and 3.2 swallows the error and registers via the fallback. Applied independently of `--bin` (the defect is in Click's template, not the callback's binary resolution)
- [x] Tests: fresh install, idempotent re-install, round-trip byte-equality, foreign-block refusal, missing rc file — 32 new tests in `tests/test_completion.py` (716 passed total), including two that source the installed block in a **real bash** to pin registration (3.2 and 5.x alike) and silence against a dead `--bin`

**Two implementation decisions worth flagging.** (1) The plan's "rc-block eval" is implemented as the script's **bytes inline** in the sentinel block, not `eval "$(project-guide completion show)"` — same rc-time evaluation, but no Python subprocess on every interactive shell start and nothing that can print when the install goes stale. (2) `install --shell zsh` **refuses** rather than writing the bash-shaped block into `~/.zshrc`; the zsh route needs its own fpath artifact and `compinit` bootstrap (R.e).

Verified end-to-end with the shipped code, binary off `PATH`: **13 completions on bash 3.2.57 and 5.3.15** — the first time completion has registered at all on stock macOS bash. Byte-clean round-trip and stale-install silence confirmed against a real rc file.

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.e: `completion install` / `uninstall` — zsh fpath route [Done]

The asymmetric half. zsh gets the autoload file its `#compdef` header is designed for, which means two on-disk artifacts instead of one.

- [x] Write the post-processed script to a zsh autoload directory as `_project-guide` — `install_autoload_file`; the directory defaults to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/project-guide/zsh-completions` (`~/.local/share/…` fallback), overridable with a new `--dir`. A project-guide-owned directory was chosen over a shared one like `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions` precisely so `uninstall` can remove it without wondering whose files it is deleting. No backup for this artifact — unlike the rc file, it is entirely our own regenerable output
- [x] Add the `fpath` line plus the `compinit` bootstrap to the rc file, sentinel-bracketed — `build_zsh_bootstrap`, carried by R.d's existing block machinery unchanged
- [x] Bootstrap shape: `(( $+functions[compdef] )) || { autoload -Uz compinit && compinit -i; } 2>/dev/null` — leave an existing `compinit` alone — **the planned shape proved insufficient; see the amendment below.** Shipped shape guards on the autoload file being readable, then branches: `compdef` exists → `autoload -Uz _project-guide && compdef _project-guide project-guide`; otherwise → `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit -i`. The `2>/dev/null` silence and the leave-an-existing-`compinit`-alone intent are both preserved
- [x] `uninstall` removes **both** the autoload file and the rc block — `remove_autoload_file`; the default (project-guide-owned) directory is `rmdir`'d when emptying it leaves nothing behind, while a user-supplied `--dir` is always left in place
- [x] Idempotency and byte-clean round-trip hold across both artifacts — "already current" requires *both* to be unchanged, so a deleted autoload file with an intact rc block still reports a refresh rather than a spurious no-op
- [x] Tests: fresh install, re-install, round-trip, partial state (file present but rc line absent, and the reverse) — 21 new tests (737 passed total), including three that source the generated block in a **real zsh** and assert on `$_comps`, the table `compinit` actually consults

**Amendment — the planned bootstrap misses the common case.** The plan's two-liner handles only "`compinit` never ran" (field defect 1). It does not handle "`compinit` already ran," which is what happens for most users, because the block lands at the *end* of `~/.zshrc` — after oh-my-zsh or a hand-rolled `compinit`. An `fpath` entry added at that point is never scanned. Verified directly rather than reasoned about: with `fpath` extended *before* `compinit`, `_comps[project-guide]` is `_project-guide`; extended *after*, it is unset. Hence the explicit-registration branch. A third requirement fell out of the same investigation: registering a `compdef` against a deleted autoload file defers its failure to TAB time, so the whole block is wrapped in `[[ -r <file> ]]` and a half-uninstalled state is inert rather than noisy.

**Also in this story:** `--dir` is refused for bash (it names an fpath directory bash's single-block route has no use for) — silently ignoring it would let a user believe they had placed the script somewhere. R.d's `install --shell zsh` refusal is gone.

Verified end-to-end with the shipped code, binary off `PATH`: a real interactive zsh (scrubbed environment, `env -i`) reports `_comps[project-guide] = _project-guide`; the autoload file loads cleanly under `autoload -Uz +X`; the baked callback returns 13 candidates. Idempotent re-install, partial-state repair, byte-clean rc round-trip and autoload-file removal all confirmed against real files.

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.f: `completion status` [Done]

Makes failure inspectable — the surface whose absence let both field defects hide.

- [x] Report per shell: **absent** / **installed** / **stale** — `inspect_shell` returns a `ShellStatus`; **both** shells are reported unless `--shell` narrows it, deliberately: the field defect was a user whose zsh worked and whose bash did not, which a current-shell-only report would hide
- [x] **Stale** = a baked `--bin` path that no longer resolves — the pyve-toolchain-bump case — tested with `os.access(path, os.X_OK)`, the *same* predicate the installed script bakes in, so `status` and the shell cannot disagree. A file that exists but lost its executable bit reads as stale here exactly as it fails at TAB time; an `exists()` check would have diverged
- [x] Detect partial installs (zsh file without rc line, or the reverse) and report them distinctly — a distinct `partial` state naming which half is missing and what that means ("the autoload file is missing, so the rc block does nothing")
- [x] Exit-code semantics consistent with the existing CLI conventions — **0** everything absent or current, **1** any shell stale/partial/damaged, **2** I/O error. Absent is deliberately **0**: an uninstalled convenience is not drift, the same rule R.h inherits for `heal`'s silence
- [x] Tests: each state per shell, including partial and stale — 22 new tests (759 passed total)

**Two states beyond the checklist, both found by running the surface rather than by reading it.** (1) A **`damaged`** state for a sentinel block that cannot be parsed: `_read_block_body` degrades to reporting instead of raising, because a reporting surface that crashes on the damage it exists to report is useless. Its remedy line is *suppressed* — `install` refuses to guess where an unterminated block ends and fails with the identical error, so suggesting it would send the user in a circle (`reinstall_fixes_it`, pinned by a test that asserts the suggestion would in fact have failed). (2) A **note when a foreign block is present** — pyve's legacy wiring shows up as `absent` + a note, which is honest (project-guide's own wiring *is* absent) and is the state R.g resolves.

Also handled: a bare-name install bakes no guard at all, so the dead-path test cannot apply — reported as `installed` with a note that the callback resolves through `PATH`, never as stale. And for zsh the autoload directory is read out of the installed `fpath` line rather than assumed from the default, since the shell obeys the rc file and a report about a directory nothing consults would be worse than no report.

**Known gap, deliberately not closed here.** Staleness is the dead-path test only. A block generated by an older project-guide whose template has since changed is *not* detected, even though the version stamp R.d put in the block would make it detectable. Widening the definition would change what R.h's `heal` warning fires on, so it stays out of this story's scope; flagged for R.h/R.i.

Refactor pass tightened two output defects the first green revealed: the `stale` detail no longer repeats the path already shown as `binary:`, and the foreign-block notice is phrased neutrally for a read-only report rather than reusing `install`'s "leaving it untouched" wording (`_foreign_block_headers` now returns bare headers, framed by each caller).

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.g: Legacy pyve sentinel adoption [Done]

Users already carry pyve's block. Without this, `install` produces a second block registering the same completion.

- [x] Detect pyve's exact legacy sentinel pair (`# >>> project-guide completion (added by pyve) >>>` … `# <<< project-guide completion <<<`) — `_find_pyve_block_span`, keyed on the **header**: pyve's terminator is byte-identical to ours, so a search anchored on the closing sentinel could not tell the two blocks apart
- [x] Replace it with project-guide's own block and report the replacement in one line — `RcResult.adopted_legacy` drives `Replaced pyve's completion block (it registered the same completion)`. Replacement happens **at pyve's position**, which is a correctness requirement rather than a nicety (see below)
- [x] Belt-and-braces with pyve's own upgrade-path cleanup — the two tools upgrade independently, so neither may assume the other ran — adoption is unconditional on every `install`, so it fires whether or not pyve has cleaned up, and re-fires if pyve re-adds its block later. Recognition spans pyve *generations*: both the current `_pyve_pg_bin` form (bash and zsh variants) and the older `command -v project-guide && eval …` form
- [x] Tests: legacy block present alone, legacy + project-guide block both present, legacy block hand-modified — 14 new tests (771 passed total)

**Why replacement must happen in place.** pyve does not append its block — `add_project_guide_completion` calls `insert_text_before_sdkman_marker_or_append`, deliberately placing the block *above* SDKMan's "must be at the end of the file" marker. Removing pyve's block and appending ours at the tail would move project-guide's wiring past that marker. Verified against a realistic rc file carrying the real pyve block plus an SDKMan footer: the adopted block lands exactly where pyve's was, SDKMan stays last, and completion still returns 13 candidates in a real bash with the binary off `PATH`.

**The adoption boundary, kept explicit.** R.d's rule was "only project-guide's own sentinel is touched." R.g is the single sanctioned exception, and it is bounded twice over: by pyve's exact header, *and* by `_is_pyve_generated`, which requires every body line to be plausibly pyve's output. A block someone has since edited is foreign again — left untouched with the usual warning, ours installed alongside. That boundary is stated in the code next to the token list so it does not erode later.

**Two consequences worth noting.** (1) When both blocks are present, ours is refreshed in place and pyve's duplicate is deleted — and the result is never reported as `UNCHANGED`, because removing the duplicate is a write even when our own block is byte-identical. (2) Two R.d tests were retargeted: they asserted "a foreign block is left untouched" using pyve's genuine block, which is now correctly *adopted*. Their intent is intact, exercised against hand-rolled wiring that is nobody's generated output.

Refactor pass extracted `_drop_separator_blank`, now shared by `remove_block` and the duplicate-deletion path rather than duplicated.

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.h: `heal` stale-completion warning [Done]

Follows the established warn-don't-auto-fix pattern (tracked-`go.md`, local-install-under-pyve). Catches the pyve toolchain-version bump that rots a baked path.

- [x] `heal` warns on stderr when completion is installed but **stale** — `_warn_if_completion_stale` in `cli.py`, consuming R.f's `inspect_shell`. Warns on **partial** too: a half-installed zsh pair is just as silently broken, and surfacing that is the same job. Silent on **damaged** — only a human can repair an unparseable block, and `install` fails with the same parse error, so there would be nothing actionable to say
- [x] Warning names the dead path and gives the copyable remedy (`project-guide completion install`) — per shell, so a user whose zsh works and whose bash does not sees exactly which one to fix
- [x] **Never auto-repairs** — writing to a user's rc file without being asked is out of bounds, same constraint that bounds the `git-push` wrapper — pinned by a test asserting the rc file is byte-identical afterward *and* that no `.bak.*` was written
- [x] Silent when completion is absent (an uninstalled convenience is not drift) and when current
- [x] Preserves the auto-hook's steady-state silence — pinned by a test asserting `--version` emits **empty stderr** with completion installed and healthy
- [x] Tests: stale warns, current silent, absent silent, `--no-input` unaffected — 12 new tests in `tests/test_cli.py` (783 passed total)

**Fires from the hook, not from `heal`.** The warning is registered in `_run_pre_invoke_hook` only. That is what makes it catch a toolchain bump without the user thinking to run `heal` — matching the Subphase Q-4 split, where the local-install *warning* fires from both surfaces and only the interactive *offer* is `heal`-scoped. There is no offer here; this is warn-only, so one call site gives complete coverage (the hook runs ahead of every subcommand, `heal` included).

**Observed while wiring it up — pre-existing, not fixed here.** The two older warnings *are* registered at both call sites, so `project-guide heal` prints each of them **twice** (verified: the tracked-`go.md` warning appears 2× in a real run). This story does not propagate that — a test pins the completion warning at exactly one occurrence during `heal` — but the sibling duplication is untouched, since fixing it means editing behavior outside this story's scope. **Recommend a small follow-up story** to de-duplicate `_warn_if_go_md_tracked` and `_warn_if_local_install_under_pyve` the same way.

**`--no-input` is silent**, matching both siblings rather than the non-suppressible auto-heal notice. Completion is an interactive-shell convenience; a CI run has no shell to repair, so the warning would be pure log noise. The story's "`--no-input` unaffected" is satisfied in the stronger sense: no new prompts, no change to auto-yes semantics, and no new CI output.

**Inherited gap, still open.** Staleness remains R.f's dead-path test only, so a block generated by an older project-guide with a since-changed template does not warn. Flagged in R.f, flagged again here as the last story where it would naturally land before R.i documents the behavior.

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.h.1: De-duplicate the pre-invoke warnings [Done]

Surfaced by R.h. `_warn_if_go_md_tracked` and `_warn_if_local_install_under_pyve` are each registered at **two** call sites — the pre-invoke hook *and* the `heal` command — so `project-guide heal` prints both warnings **twice**. Verified in a real run: the tracked-`go.md` warning appears 2×. R.h avoided propagating the pattern (its warning fires from the hook only, pinned by a test), leaving these two as the remaining offenders.

The hook's coverage is already complete for both. Every path where `heal` reaches its warning calls is one where `.project-guide.yml` existed and `Config.load` succeeded — exactly the condition under which the hook ran its own warnings a moment earlier. The recursion-guard and `should_skip_input` gates are checked inside each warning, so they behave identically at either site.

**The two warnings are not symmetric, and that is the whole design problem:**

- `_warn_if_go_md_tracked` is a **pure duplicate** — drop `heal`'s call, exactly as R.h did.
- `_warn_if_local_install_under_pyve` is **not**: `heal` passes `offer_provision=True`, and the interactive provisioning offer is deliberately `heal`-scoped (a Subphase Q-4 invariant — the auto-hook warns but never prompts). Deleting `heal`'s call would delete the offer with it. What must be suppressed is the *warning body* on the second call, not the call.

- [x] Remove `heal`'s `_warn_if_go_md_tracked` call; the hook already covers it
- [x] Make the local-install warning body emit once per process while `heal` keeps its provisioning offer — either a once-per-process emit guard (a module-level set, which generalizes to any future warning) or an explicit "offer only, already warned" parameter. Prefer whichever keeps the Q-4 invariant legible in the code — **chose the parameter** (`already_warned`). The function already takes `offer_provision`, so the two flags sit together and read as one statement about who warns and who prompts; a module-level guard would have added process-global mutable state to buy generality for warnings that do not exist yet
- [x] If a once-per-process guard is chosen, add a test fixture that resets it, and make sure the reset is automatic rather than something each test must remember — **not applicable**: the parameter approach carries no cross-invocation state, which was a large part of why it won
- [x] Preserve every existing gate unchanged: recursion guard, `should_skip_input`, and the Q-4 rule that `pip uninstall` advice is emitted **only** on `pyve self provision --status` exit 0 — untouched; `already_warned` gates *printing*, never *deciding*, so no branch condition moved
- [x] Tests: each warning appears exactly once during `heal`; each still appears from the hook on a non-`heal` subcommand; the provisioning offer still appears under `heal`; steady-state silence preserved — 7 new tests in `tests/test_cli.py` (790 passed total), including one asserting the hook alone still never prompts

**Both exit branches needed the suppression, not just one.** The readiness-first branch is the one carrying the offer, so it was the obvious case — but the exit-0 branch duplicated too, and that is the branch carrying the destructive `pip uninstall` advice. Printing removal advice twice is the worse of the two defects. It takes an early return rather than a skipped `secho`, since that branch has no offer to fall through to.

**`heal` now calls one warning instead of three.** `_warn_if_go_md_tracked` and `_warn_if_completion_stale` are not called from `heal` at all; `_warn_if_local_install_under_pyve` is called solely for its heal-scoped offer. The comment at the call site states the invariant that makes this safe — the hook fires ahead of every subcommand and reaches its warnings under exactly the conditions `heal` does (config present and loadable) — so a future maintainer adding a fourth warning knows not to re-register it here.

Verified in a real run, not just under the test runner: `project-guide heal` with `go.md` tracked prints the warning **once** (it printed twice before this story), and `project-guide status` still prints it once from the hook.

**Scope note.** This is `heal`-warning hygiene rather than shell completion, so it sits slightly outside Subphase R-1's theme. It is placed here because R.h discovered it and it is small enough to ride the same release; move it out of the subphase if you would rather keep R-1 thematically pure.

No version bump — Subphase R-1 ships bundled as `v2.19.0` at R.i, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.i: `v2.19.0` Subphase R-1 bundled release [Done]

Documentation and the single release tag for the subphase.

- [x] Rewrite `features.md` FR-7 — replace the hand-copied-snippet framing with the `completion` command group; remove the "Known limitations" block added in R.?'s `features.md` pass, now that both defects are closed; **state the fish gap explicitly** so the docs stop over-promising — rewritten around the four subcommands, the two routes, the rc-file safety contract, and `heal` integration. The old limitations block is replaced by a **Known gaps** block, since the two *original* defects are closed but four honest gaps remain (fish, bash 3.2 `compopt`, dead-path-only staleness, PowerShell)
- [x] Document the implementation in `tech-spec.md` — the two route mechanisms, post-processing, sentinel machinery, and rc-file safety contract — new § "Shell Completion Installation (Subphase R-1)", plus `completion.py` and `test_completion.py` in the package-structure tree, `CompletionError` (and the previously-missing `ActionError`) in the exception hierarchy, the test count refreshed 629 → 790, and a CLI-design note on which completion subcommands take `--quiet` / `--no-input` and why
- [x] Update `README.md` and `docs/site/user-guide/commands.md` with the new command group; revise the Shell Completion sections in `README.md` and `docs/site/user-guide/install-options.md` — plus a `completion` row in the commands overview table, a stale-completion bullet in `heal`'s **Warnings** list, and **one surface the checklist missed**: `docs/site/user-guide/configuration.md` carried its own copy of the three-shell snippet instructions (found by grepping for `_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=` across all docs rather than trusting the list)
- [x] Record the macOS system-bash 3.2 limitation accurately — **narrowed by R.d**: the registration half is *closed* (the emitted `complete -o nosort … 2>/dev/null || complete …` fallback registers on 3.2), so what remains is only `compopt` (bash ≥ 4.0) breaking **dir/file** completions there. Document the residual limitation, not the pre-spike "nothing works" wording and not R.b Amendment 4's "nothing registers at all," which R.d superseded — stated in FR-7, the CHANGELOG, and `install-options.md`, each naming what *does* work there so the limitation is not read as "bash 3.2 is unsupported"
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` entry for `v2.19.0`, dated 2026-08-12 — Added / Changed / Fixed / Known limitations. The **Fixed** section covers R.h.1's double-printed `heal` warnings and R.c's stdout leak into `eval "$(… completion show)"`, both of which are user-visible fixes that would otherwise have shipped unannounced
- [x] Bump `project_guide/version.py` and `pyproject.toml` to `2.19.0`
- [x] Verification per CI-gate parity: `pyve test` (790 passed), `pyve env run ruff check project_guide/ tests/` (clean), `pyve env run mypy project_guide/` (clean) — plus `mkdocs build --strict`, which passes and confirms the new cross-document links and anchors resolve
- [x] **Fix the Windows CI failures the subphase introduced** (7 failures on the `windows-latest` / Python 3.12 matrix leg; macOS and Linux were green throughout). Three distinct causes, none of them a bug in the shipped behavior on the platforms completion targets — see the breakdown below
- [x] Make the completion tests platform-honest rather than POSIX-literal: module-level `BIN` / `BIN_QUOTED` built with `os.sep` + `os.path.abspath` + `shlex.quote`, so every assertion compares against what the product actually bakes in on the running platform
- [x] Skip the executable-bit staleness test on Windows, where the case is *unrepresentable* rather than broken (`os.access(…, os.X_OK)` is True for any readable file); the dominant staleness cause — the path being gone — is still covered on every platform
- [x] Stop the stdout-purity test tripping over CliRunner's simulated typing (`_without_prompt_echo`), which lands in captured stdout on Windows and captured stderr on macOS
- [x] **Record the Windows gap in the docs rather than papering over it** — FR-7 known gaps, `install-options.md` known limitations, and the `v2.19.0` CHANGELOG entry all now say bash/zsh completion is macOS- and Linux-supported and **unverified on Windows**
- [x] **Second Windows round — fix the `isabs` trap where it actually bit** (1 failure, `windows-latest` / Python **3.13**). `test_install_autoload_file_refreshes_a_changed_script` fed `build_script` the literals `/old/project-guide` and `/new/project-guide`; under 3.13's `ntpath.isabs` neither is absolute, so post-processing was skipped for both, the two scripts came out byte-identical, and the refresh reported `UNCHANGED`. Now built with the shared helper
- [x] Promote the platform-correct path construction to a named helper, `abs_bin(*parts)`, with the trap spelled out beside it — the first round fixed the `BIN` literal but left two ad-hoc ones, which is precisely the recurrence a helper prevents
- [x] Guard the invariant with a test (`test_abs_bin_is_absolute_on_this_platform`) so a reintroduced literal fails loudly instead of degrading into a silent `UNCHANGED`, and strengthen the refresh test to assert the **new** path is present rather than only that the old one is absent

**The three Windows causes, and why none is a shipped-behavior bug on macOS/Linux.**

1. **Platform-dependent path resolution (5 of the 7).** `resolve_bin` runs its argument through `os.path.abspath`, so on Windows `--bin /opt/pg/project-guide` becomes `D:\opt\pg\project-guide`, and `shlex.quote` then wraps it because of the backslashes. The tests asserted on a hard-coded POSIX literal that could only ever match on POSIX. A second, quieter version of the same trap: `build_script` gates post-processing on `os.path.isabs`, and `ntpath.isabs("/opt/…")` was True through Python 3.12 but is **False from 3.13** — so the old literal also silently changed *whether post-processing ran at all*, depending on the interpreter. Both are closed by deriving the path the way the platform does.
2. **No executable bit on Windows (1).** `os.access(path, os.X_OK)` returns True for any readable file, so a `chmod 0o644` binary cannot read as stale there. This is the predicate deliberately chosen in R.f to agree with the script's own `[[ -x ]]` guard; on Windows there is nothing for it to agree *with*.
3. **A test-harness artifact, not a stdout leak (1).** Click's `CliRunner` replaces `visible_prompt_func` with one that writes the prompt suffix and the supplied answer to `sys.stdout`, standing in for terminal echo — and that lands in captured **stdout** on Windows and captured **stderr** on macOS. A real terminal echoes keystrokes to the tty, never into the program's stdout, so it cannot reach a command substitution. The R.c guarantee is intact; the assertion was measuring the harness.

**What was deliberately *not* done.** The real finding underneath cause 1 is that the command group bakes Windows-convention paths into POSIX shell scripts, which is wrong for git-bash/MSYS — the only plausible Windows consumer. Making it correct there cannot be validated from this machine, and refusing to run on Windows would be a behavior change that might break a git-bash user who is fine today. So the behavior is unchanged, the gap is documented in three places, and the decision — support git-bash properly, or refuse with a clear message — is **recommended as a follow-on story** rather than guessed at here.

**The `isabs` trap deserved a helper, not a patch — a lesson learned twice.** Round one identified the Python-3.13 `ntpath.isabs` hazard and wrote it into a comment, but only fixed the one literal that had actually failed (`/opt/pg/project-guide`, on the 3.12 leg). Two ad-hoc literals in a different test were examined and waved through: their `not in` assertion passes either way, and the *outcome* assertion that does not was missed. The 3.13 leg then failed on exactly the hazard already documented one screen above it. Two takeaways worth carrying forward: **a hazard that is understood well enough to write down is understood well enough to make structurally impossible** — `abs_bin()` plus its invariant test does what the comment could not; and **when a platform bug is found, sweep every call site of the same shape immediately**, because the matrix leg that exposes the rest may be a different one.

**Three process notes.** (1) The doc surfaces were found by grep rather than by working the checklist, which is how `configuration.md` surfaced; the checklist named four files and there were five. (2) The strict docs build initially failed for a missing plugin, and installing the docs toolchain into the **main** venv was the wrong move — dev tooling belongs in the test env. The runtime venv was restored to exactly its four declared dependencies (`click`, `jinja2`, `pyyaml`, `packaging`) and re-verified; the docs toolchain now lives in `testenv`, matching the `pyve` two-environment rule. (3) Neither Windows round is reproducible from this machine: the failures depend on `ntpath` semantics *and* on Windows' drive-relative `abspath`, which cannot be faithfully simulated on POSIX (`ntpath.abspath` on macOS yields a driveless path). Local verification is therefore reasoning plus targeted simulation, and the CI matrix is the real oracle — which is the argument for the invariant test rather than another careful read-through.

**Subphase R-1 ships here.** Stories R.b (spike) through R.h.1, one release tag, `v2.19.0`. Phase R therefore carries two release tags (`v2.18.1` from R.a predates the subphase) — the documented multi-release exception recorded in the subphase plan.

## Subphase R-2: Pyve Detection & Render Gate

A single failed pyve detection at `init` permanently strips the entire Pyve guidance section (~80 lines) from `go.md`, and nothing ever re-detects. Every command exits 0; nothing warns. Documented in `docs/specs/pyve-detection-render-gate.md`.

The omitted content is the guardrail itself — use `pyve test` not `pyve run pytest`, the two-environment isolation rule, don't `pip install -e ".[dev]"` into the main venv. A project in this state hands its LLM a guide that never mentions pyve, so the LLM does the plausible wrong thing. Full plan, decisions, and out-of-scope negotiation: [`phase-r-subphase-2-pyve-detection-plan.md`](phase-r-subphase-2-pyve-detection-plan.md). Ships as one bundled release, **`v2.20.0`** (Story R.o); stories before it run unversioned.

**The load-bearing rule** (from the plan): **automatic detection may only ever set `pyve_installed` to `true`, never to `false`.** Once a project has seen pyve once, no later probe failure can strip the guidance again.

**Refresh sites:** `update` and an explicit `mode <name>` switch — **never `_apply_heal`**, which the pre-invoke auto-hook calls on every command. A pyve subprocess there is the Q.t (v2.15.1) hang class.

---

### Story R.j: Decouple the render gate — persist `pyve_installed` [Done]

The core fix. Deriving `pyve_installed` from `config.pyve_version is not None` is what turns a *detection miss* into *content loss* — the two answer different questions ("should the guidance render?" vs. "which pyve was seen?") and must stop sharing one field.

- [x] Add `pyve_installed: bool` to the `Config` dataclass with YAML round-trip — `config.py:100`, defaulting to `False`, with the why-not-derived reasoning recorded on the field itself
- [x] Migration default on read: `pyve_version is not None`, so no existing project changes behavior at the moment of upgrade — and a key that *is* present always wins, which is what lets a hand-edited opt-out survive a load
- [x] Confirm this is additive-with-default and therefore does **not** bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` (per the config-schema policy in `project-essentials.md`) — verified against `Config.load`'s actual `data.get(key, default)` shape rather than assumed; pinned by a test asserting `SCHEMA_VERSION == "2.0"`, because bumping for an additive field would make every existing project fail to load until it ran `init --force`
- [x] Replace the derivation at all four render call sites — `init` (`cli.py:272`), `set_mode` (694), `update` (1136), `_apply_heal` (1216) — with `config.pyve_installed` — **the recorded line numbers had drifted ~250 lines** (Subphase R-1 grew `cli.py`), so the sites were found by what they do; they are now `cli.py:295`/`315` (init render + persist), `718` (`set_mode`), `1160` (`update`), `1240` (`_apply_heal`)
- [x] Implement the **sticky-true** helper: a single function through which every automatic update flows, which can set the flag `true` but never `false` — `Config.record_pyve_detection(detected_version) -> bool`. Returns whether anything changed so callers can skip a pointless config write, which is the hook R.l needs
- [x] Tests: migration default for a legacy config, sticky-true holds across a failed probe, all four render sites read the persisted flag, an explicitly-`false` hand-edited config is respected — 16 new tests (808 passed total)

**`init` is deliberately outside the sticky-true rule.** It is the one site allowed to record a miss as `false`, because there is no prior observation to overwrite — this is the project's first answer, not a revision of one. It now names the decision in a single local (`detected_pyve_installed`) that both the render call and the persisted `Config` read, so the file can never disagree with what was just rendered.

**Two pre-existing tests encoded the old contract and were updated.** `test_go_md_omits_pyve_essentials_when_pyve_not_installed` and `test_header_common_pip_branch_when_pyve_absent` both expressed "pyve is absent" by nulling `pyve_version` alone, and both began failing — correctly. Under the decoupling, a version going away no longer strips the guidance; that *is* the fix. They now set `pyve_installed: false`, which is how the config expresses absence. Worth noting they were also quietly machine-dependent before: they only passed because they nulled the one field the gate read, and on a machine where `init` detects pyve they now exercise a genuinely explicit opt-out.

**The plan's production concern, confirmed rather than assumed.** The plan flagged that a re-render newly *adding* the section is a content change to a managed file and asked for an explicit check that no `.bak` proliferation results. Verified end-to-end on a real project: a config stuck at `pyve_installed: false` renders a 160-line `go.md`; flipping the flag re-renders at 240 lines — the ~80 lines of guardrail restored — with **zero** backup files created. Also verified the migration path on a real legacy config (no `pyve_installed` key, `pyve_version: 'pyve 3.2.2'`): the guidance renders immediately from the derived default, and the next `mode` persists `pyve_installed: true`, which is exactly the "changes on the next `update` / `mode`" repair the plan describes.

No version bump — Subphase R-2 ships bundled as `v2.20.0` at R.o, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.k: Host-supplied pyve version — `--pyve-version` / `PYVE_VERSION` [Done]

pyve invokes `project-guide init` and knows its own version with certainty. Accept it and skip the guess. Same shape as `--bin` in Subphase R-1: project-guide owns the rendering decision; the host tool supplies the fact it is uniquely positioned to know.

- [x] Add `--pyve-version` to `init`, plus the `PYVE_VERSION` env-var equivalent
- [x] Resolution chain mirrors `--project-name`: CLI flag → env var → `PATH` probe — with one difference that had to be built rather than borrowed: the last link is a **subprocess**, so it is evaluated lazily. `_resolve_setting` takes its `default` eagerly, which would have probed on every `init` regardless of what the host supplied, so the chain is hand-written in `_resolve_pyve_version`
- [x] A supplied value wins outright and sets `pyve_installed=true` without probing — the probe is extracted into `_probe_pyve_version`, and a test fixture (`no_probe`) makes calling it a hard failure, so "skips the subprocess" is asserted directly rather than inferred from the recorded version
- [x] `init` only — **not** elevated to `update` / `mode`; later changes are handled by re-detection (R.l), not by more flags — pinned by a test asserting both commands still exit 2 on the flag
- [x] Document the shared "host-supplied fact" pattern (`--bin`, `--pyve-version`, `--project-name`) so the three read as one idea — new `tech-spec.md` § with the rule, a comparison table, the four shared properties, and **where the pattern deliberately stops**
- [x] Tests: flag wins over env, env wins over probe, supplied value skips the subprocess entirely, malformed value handling — 13 new tests (821 passed total)

**"Malformed value handling" resolved as: do not validate.** The field records an observation, not a constraint — `pyve_version` already tolerates both the bare `3.2.2` and the legacy `pyve version 3.2.2` forms — and refusing a value the host asserts about *itself* would be project-guide second-guessing the one component that knows for certain, with validation that would inevitably lag pyve's own format changes. What *is* handled is the blank case: an empty or whitespace-only flag or env var means **not supplied** and falls through to the next link. A host interpolating an unset shell variable produces exactly that, and treating it as an answer would record a useless version *and* skip the probe that would have found the real one. Values are stripped, since surrounding whitespace is a transport artifact.

**Verified where it actually matters — with pyve absent.** Run under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` so `pyve` genuinely does not exist: `--pyve-version 3.2.2` records the version, sets `pyve_installed: true`, and renders the guidance into `go.md`; `PYVE_VERSION=3.3.0` does the same; supplying neither records `null` / `false`. That is not an incidental test environment — it is the pyve-hosting case, where project-guide runs from a toolchain venv whose child process need not have `pyve` on `PATH` at all. The flag works exactly where the probe cannot.

No version bump — Subphase R-2 ships bundled as `v2.20.0` at R.o, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.l: Re-detect on `update` and explicit `mode <name>` [Done]

`pyve_version` is a cache, so treat it as one. This converts a permanent failure into a transient one.

- [x] Refresh detection during `update` and during an explicit `mode <name>` switch; write the refreshed value back to `.project-guide.yml` — one helper, `_refresh_pyve_detection(config, config_path) -> bool` (`cli.py:196`), through which both sites flow; it delegates sticky-true to R.j's `record_pyve_detection` and skips the write when nothing changed
- [x] **Do not** refresh in `_apply_heal` — it runs in the pre-invoke auto-hook on every command, including `--help` and `--version`
- [x] Add a regression test asserting the auto-hook path performs **no** pyve subprocess. This is the Q.t (v2.15.1) hang class and the guard must be explicit, not incidental — guarded at **both** layers: the helper, and `subprocess.run` itself, so a future re-implementation that shells out directly fails too
- [x] Inherit the Q.t probe discipline: bounded `timeout`, every exception class caught, failure degrades to "leave the cached value alone" — inherited unchanged from R.k's `_probe_pyve_version`, and now pinned by tests that drive the *real* probe rather than a stub
- [x] A failed refresh is silent (absence is the steady state for non-pyve projects) and leaves `pyve_installed` untouched per sticky-true
- [x] Tests: pyve appears after a bad init and the section returns on next `update`; same via `mode`; hook performs no probe; probe timeout does not fail the command — 17 new tests (838 passed total); lint clean; mypy clean

**The config-only fix that would have shipped.** `update` re-renders `go.md` only when a template drifted or the file is missing, and the repair case has **neither** trigger — a project whose `init` missed pyve is otherwise perfectly in sync. Refreshing the config alone would have flipped `pyve_installed` to `true` in YAML while the file on disk kept the guidance stripped, so the detection result now joins that condition (`cli.py:1257`). A dedicated test asserts `"Already current"` and the restored section in the same run, so the two cannot drift apart again.

**Refresh placement in `mode` is what excludes the listing.** The probe sits after the mode is validated and before the render (`cli.py:802`), which the bare `project-guide mode` listing never reaches — it returns earlier. So "explicit switch refreshes, listing does not" falls out of control flow rather than needing a flag to test for, and an interactively-selected mode gets the refresh for free, correctly: it is the same explicit switch.

**`--dry-run` skips the refresh entirely.** It promises to change nothing, and a config write is a something — so it would otherwise pay for a subprocess to compute a value it must throw away.

**A hand-edited `pyve_installed: false` no longer survives while pyve is installed.** R.j described turning the flag off as "an explicit user action — hand-editing `.project-guide.yml`", and that edit stood only because nothing re-detected. It cannot be preserved now: at refresh time a hand-written `false` is byte-identical to the `false` a missed probe wrote at `init`, and repairing the latter is the point of this story. Sticky-true therefore means *detection wins upward*, leaving no durable opt-out on a pyve-having machine — the deliberate direction of the asymmetry (irrelevant guidance is noise; missing guidance is a removed guardrail), with a real `auto|always|never` setting named out of scope in the subphase plan. The consequence is now asserted by a test rather than left to be discovered, and **three pre-existing tests that encoded the old contract were updated** — `test_go_md_omits_pyve_essentials_when_pyve_not_installed`, `test_header_common_pip_branch_when_pyve_absent`, and R.j's `test_mode_omits_pyve_guidance_when_the_flag_is_off_despite_a_version` all expressed "pyve absent" by hand-editing the flag and then invoking `mode`, which now correctly re-detects. They pin the probe to "not found", which also retires the quiet machine-dependence R.j flagged in them.

**Verified end-to-end against a real project, including the guard.** `init` run under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` produces the genuine broken state (`pyve_installed: false`, 160-line `go.md`, no guidance). With pyve back on `PATH`: `update` restores it to 240 lines with `Already current` for every template — proving the re-render came from the detection change alone — and **zero** `.bak` files; `mode code_test_first` does the same via the other site. The no-probe guard was *observed*, not inferred: a fake `pyve` shim on `PATH` that logs every invocation records **0** calls across drift-triggered `--version` and `--help` runs (the auto-hook healed a template and re-rendered without probing), **0** for the bare `mode` listing, and exactly **1** (`--version`) for the explicit switch. Removing pyve from `PATH` again leaves both fields intact and prints nothing.

No version bump — Subphase R-2 ships bundled as `v2.20.0` at R.o, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.m: Warn loudly on a detection miss at `init` [Done]

A silent `null` is indistinguishable from a deliberate non-pyve project. This converts an invisible failure into a visible one.

- [x] `init` emits a stderr warning when detection fails: pyve not found, the Pyve guidance will be omitted, and the remedy (`project-guide update` once pyve is available) — `cli.py:445`, naming the concrete `go.md` path rather than the abstraction, so the reader can see the file that lost the content
- [x] Material warning per FR-9 — emitted on stderr even under `--quiet`, and under `--no-input` too: unlike the P.o "intentionally untracked" *note* (which `skip_input` suppresses), this reports content that will be missing from every render, and the embedded / CI case is where an unnoticed miss does the most damage
- [x] Fires at `init` only (a once-per-project event), **not** on every refresh failure in R.l — the warning must not become startup noise
- [x] Suppressed when the version was host-supplied (R.k), since no detection was attempted
- [x] Tests: warning on miss, silence on success, silence when host-supplied, present under `--quiet` — 11 new tests (849 passed total); lint clean; mypy clean

**The suppression reads a fact instead of re-deriving one.** "Was this host-supplied?" is answerable at the call site only by re-walking flag → env var → probe, which would be a second copy of R.k's precedence rules with its own drift. `_resolve_pyve_version` now returns a `PyveVersionResolution(version, probed)` NamedTuple (`cli.py:171`) and the warning condition is simply `probed and version is None`. Suppression is then structural: a host-supplied value returns `probed=False` on the same line that short-circuits the chain, so the two cannot disagree. A test asserts the resolver's contract directly, and another pins the case the shortcut would have gotten wrong — a **blank** `--pyve-version` means *not supplied* (R.k), so the probe really did run and really did miss, and the warning fires. Keying off "was the flag typed?" would have silenced exactly the host that interpolated an unset shell variable.

**Verified in the real CLI, not only in tests.** Under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` with `--quiet --no-input`: stdout is **0 bytes** and the two-line warning appears on stderr, then the remedy it names (`project-guide update`, with pyve back on `PATH`) restores `pyve_installed: true` and the guidance — so the warning's advice is executable, not aspirational. Both suppression paths are silent in the same conditions: `--pyve-version 3.2.2` with pyve genuinely absent, and an ordinary `init` where detection succeeds.

**Discovered while verifying, not caused by this story: the suite is red on any machine without pyve, which includes CI.** Four render tests (`test_go_md_auto_renders_pyve_essentials_when_pyve_installed`, `test_go_md_renders_project_essentials_wrapper_even_when_only_pyve_content`, `test_go_md_has_both_project_essentials_and_pyve_essentials`, `test_header_common_pyve_branch_when_pyve_detected`) express "pyve is installed" by setting `pyve_version` alone and then rely on `init`'s **real** detection to have set the flag. Story R.j decoupled the gate from the version and fixed the two tests that failed on a pyve-*having* machine; these four are the mirror image and fail on a pyve-*lacking* one. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs no pyve, so this has been red since R.j — confirmed by stashing this story's changes and reproducing all four at `HEAD` under a stripped `PATH`. Fix deferred to **R.m.1** rather than folded in here: it is R.j's defect, not this story's, and it wants its own commit.

No version bump — Subphase R-2 ships bundled as `v2.20.0` at R.o, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.m.1: Make the pyve render tests machine-independent [Done]

The mirror image of the two tests Story R.j fixed. Four tests express "pyve is installed" by setting `pyve_version` alone and depend on `init`'s live detection for the flag the render gate actually reads — so they pass on a developer machine with pyve and fail everywhere else, CI included (`ci.yml` installs no pyve). Red since R.j; found during R.m's verification.

- [x] Fix the four: `test_go_md_auto_renders_pyve_essentials_when_pyve_installed`, `test_go_md_renders_project_essentials_wrapper_even_when_only_pyve_content`, `test_go_md_has_both_project_essentials_and_pyve_essentials`, `test_header_common_pyve_branch_when_pyve_detected` — set `pyve_installed` explicitly, and pin the probe (R.l made `mode` a refresh site) as `_detect_no_pyve` already does for the absent direction — via a new `_detect_pyve(monkeypatch, version="1.2.3")` (`test_render.py:1129`) placed beside its sibling, so the pair reads as one idea instead of a helper for one direction and hand-rolled setup for the other
- [x] Sweep for the same shape elsewhere: any test whose expectation depends on whether the *host machine* has pyve
- [x] Verify by running the full suite under a stripped `PATH` (`env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`), which is the closest local stand-in for CI
- [x] Consider whether the sweep belongs in the CI-gate-parity checklist in `project-essentials.md` — a green local run should predict a green CI run, and this class of failure is exactly what that rule exists to catch — **yes**, added

**Both halves are needed, for different reasons.** `pyve_installed: true` states the premise the gate actually reads (R.j), and pinning the probe stops the R.l refresh from overwriting it on the `mode` call every one of these tests makes. Either alone leaves a test that passes for a reason it does not name.

**The sweep, run two ways.** Empirically: the full suite passes **849** with pyve on `PATH` and **849** under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` — the same number both directions, which is the property that was missing. By inspection: `grep` for every test asserting pyve-gated content (`Pyve Essentials`, `Managed by pyve`, `Pyve manages project-guide`, `two separate environments`) and every test touching `pyve_version` / `pyve_installed`. The two `status`-footer tests (`test_cli.py:3996`, `:4014`) look like the same shape but are not: they overwrite the field unconditionally and `status` is not a refresh site, so nothing on the host can reach them.

**Checklist item added to `project-essentials.md` § Story verification.** It names the cause (`ci.yml` installs no pyve), gives the stripped-`PATH` command, and states the rule — a test needing pyve present or absent must *say so* via the `_detect_pyve` / `_detect_no_pyve` pair, never borrow the answer from `init`. Worth the tokens because the failure is invisible locally: the gate exists precisely to make a green local run predict CI, and this class walks straight through it.

Test-only story; no `project_guide/` change and no version bump — Subphase R-2 ships bundled as `v2.20.0` at R.o.

### Story R.n: Store a bare version string with a tolerant reader [Done]

The field currently holds the whole `pyve --version` line (`"pyve version 2.6.2"`), which is why `_pyve_version_token()` exists to re-parse it at display time.

- [x] Normalize to a bare `"3.2.2"` on write, from both probe output and host-supplied values — `_normalize_pyve_version` (`cli.py:152`) applied inside `_probe_pyve_version` (`:200`) and on the supplied legs of `_resolve_pyve_version` (`:240`). Normalizing *inside* the probe rather than at each caller means both write paths through it — `init` and R.l's two refresh sites — store the same shape without either having to remember to ask
- [x] Reader keeps accepting the legacy raw-stdout form — existing `.project-guide.yml` files in the wild carry it
- [x] Retire `_pyve_version_token()` (`cli.py:1281`) or reduce it to the legacy-compatibility path — **retired**, and its one caller now calls the shared normalizer (`cli.py:1188`). One function serving both roles is the point: on write it makes the value bare, on read it is a no-op for anything written since this story and the legacy path for everything older
- [x] Verify the `status` "Managed by pyve vX.Y.Z" footer still renders correctly from both stored forms
- [x] Confirm no coordinated pyve change is needed — `pyve_version` is not in the pinned cross-repo field subset (`version`, `installed_version`, `target_dir`, `current_mode`) — re-checked against the assertion that pins it (`test_cross_repo_contract.py:140`), whose docstring also states that additional fields' presence and shape are not contract
- [x] Tests: bare round-trip, legacy-form read, status footer for both forms — 16 new tests (865 passed total); lint clean; mypy clean

**Normalizing is not validating, and the tests say so separately.** R.k's rule was that project-guide does not second-guess a version the host asserts about itself. That survives intact: the normalizer never raises and never rejects — a string with no recognizable version token (`dev-build`, `from source`, `?`) is stored exactly as given, pinned by its own parametrized test. What it recognizes it simplifies; what it does not it leaves alone. The token rule also strips a leading `v`, so `v3.2.2` and `3.2.2-rc1` both come out right.

**Two pre-existing tests encoded the old storage shape and were updated.** `test_init_pyve_detected_stores_version` expected the raw `"pyve 1.2.3"` line, and R.k's `test_a_supplied_version_is_not_validated` expected `--pyve-version "pyve version 3.2.2-rc1"` stored verbatim. Both now expect the bare form. The second is the more interesting edit: its *name* still holds — nothing is rejected — but "not validated" no longer implies "stored byte-for-byte", so the docstring now draws that line explicitly and points at the pass-through test that carries the original guarantee.

**Existing projects repair themselves; no migration step.** A config holding `pyve version 3.2.2` differs from the freshly normalized `3.2.2`, so R.l's refresh reports a change and writes the bare form on the next `update` / `mode`. Until then the tolerant reader covers it — and it has to cover it indefinitely, because `status` is not a refresh site, so a config that never runs either command keeps the raw line forever.

**Verified in the real CLI.** A fresh `init` with pyve 3.2.2 on `PATH` stores `pyve_version: 3.2.2` (previously `pyve version 3.2.2`); the footer reads `Managed by pyve v3.2.2`. Hand-editing the config back to `pyve version 2.6.2` — the exact form this repo's own `.project-guide.yml` still carries — renders `Managed by pyve v2.6.2` correctly, and the next `update` rewrites it bare. Full suite green in both directions per the R.m.1 gate: **865** with pyve on `PATH`, **865** under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`.

No version bump — Subphase R-2 ships bundled as `v2.20.0` at R.o, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

### Story R.o: `v2.20.0` Subphase R-2 bundled release [Done]

Documentation and the single release tag for the subphase.

- [x] Update `features.md` FR-13 — the detection contract, the `pyve_installed` gate, sticky-true semantics, and the refresh sites — rewritten as four labelled paragraphs (resolution chain + the non-silent miss, the persisted gate, sticky-true, refresh sites incl. the `_apply_heal` exclusion); `--pyve-version` added to the `init` inputs list, and the `.project-guide.yml` example — which had drifted to five fields — now shows all nine with the schema-vs-package-version distinction spelled out
- [x] **Amend invariant (b) in `project-essentials.md`** — record `update` / explicit `mode` as a second sanctioned refresh point alongside the existing Q-4 readiness-gate exception, and state that `_apply_heal` remains off-limits with the Q.t rationale — written as *two refresh points and one hard exclusion*, framing the refresh as the invariant's own escape clause taken up rather than a loosening of it
- [x] Update `tech-spec.md` — reconcile the `Config` dataclass listing with the actual dataclass (it currently omits `project_name` as well as the new `pyve_installed`) and document the sticky-true helper — both fields added with inline comments, plus a prose block on why the gate is not derived and a signature-level description of `record_pyve_detection`; the module-level `config.py` summary, its defaults line (noting the one field whose *load* default differs from its dataclass default), and the R.k host-supplied-facts § (normalizing ≠ validating) all reconciled
- [x] Document the new config field and `--pyve-version` flag in `README.md` and `docs/site/user-guide/configuration.md` — plus `commands.md`, whose `status`-footer line still said the value came from `init` time
- [x] Confirm a re-render that newly *adds* the Pyve section is handled cleanly by the existing hash-comparison machinery, with no `.bak` proliferation
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` entry for `v2.20.0`, dated
- [x] Bump `project_guide/version.py` and `pyproject.toml` to `2.20.0`
- [x] Verification per CI-gate parity: `pyve test`, `pyve env run ruff check project_guide/ tests/`, `pyve env run mypy project_guide/` — 865 passed, ruff clean, mypy clean, plus the fourth gate R.m.1 added: **865 under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`**

**The user guide carried advice this subphase made wrong.** `configuration.md` told developers who installed pyve after `init` to "re-run `project-guide init --force`" — the destructive rebuild path, for what is now a non-destructive refresh. Replaced with `update` or a mode switch, and the page gains a `pyve_installed` section written for a developer rather than a maintainer: what the field gates, why it is not read off `pyve_version`, and that the hand-edited opt-out holds only while pyve stays genuinely unavailable. Finding this is the argument for the doc pass being a story rather than a footnote on R.j.

**The `.bak` concern, confirmed on a clean project rather than cited from earlier runs.** This story owns the claim, so it was re-verified from scratch: `init` under a stripped `PATH` (160-line `go.md`, no guidance) → `update` (240 lines, guidance restored) → a mode switch → another `update`. **Zero** backup files at every step. The adding re-render is just a content change to generated output, which the existing hash comparison already handles.

**Release shape.** Phase R now carries three tags — `v2.18.1` (R.a), `v2.19.0` (Subphase R-1), `v2.20.0` (Subphase R-2) — the documented multi-release exception rather than the preferred single bundle, driven by the subphases being independently shippable fixes to unrelated surfaces. No cross-repo coordination: `pyve_version` is not in the pyve-pinned field subset, re-checked against the assertion that pins it. The pyve-side change that passes `--pyve-version` from `run_project_guide_init_in_env` lands in the pyve repo, gated on this release.

## Subphase R-3: Branch Workflows and Doc Realignment

Two shipped surfaces do the wrong thing for consumers on branch/PR workflows, and one documented gap has now been deferred twice. `git-push <branch>` / `git-commit <branch>` decide how strictly to check committed stories by asking *which branch am I on* rather than *where is this work going*, so starting a branch from a squash-merged `main` either hard-errors or proposes a commit subject covering the entire file. gitbetter's `--keep` and `--amend` are unreachable through the wrappers, so sustained branch work means dropping to the bare command. And completion staleness is still the dead-path test only, flagged by R.f and re-flagged by R.h.

Full plan, decisions, and out-of-scope negotiation: [`phase-r-subphase-3-branch-workflows-plan.md`](phase-r-subphase-3-branch-workflows-plan.md). Ships as one bundled release, **`v2.21.0`** (Story R.t); stories before it run unversioned.

**The wrapper-value principle** (from the plan, and the test every wrapper decision below is measured against): the `project-guide` wrapper adds integration value — reading `stories.md` and `git log` so the developer copies and pastes less. Anything beyond that, use the bare `gitbetter` command.

**Scope note.** The PR-based-workflow production-readiness item stays **waived with no timeline**. R.p is a fix for *consumers* running branch/PR workflows, not a step toward adopting one in this repo; direct-to-main remains the deliberate process here.

---

### Story R.p: Destination-aware branch gate for `git-push` / `git-commit` [Done]

`project-guide git-push <branch>` and `... git-commit <branch>` check committed stories too strictly. Kicking off a new branch on a production repo whose `stories.md` holds multiple completed stories that were squash-merged to `main` makes Project Guide check the *current* branch (`main`) for those stories in the git log. They won't be there. Starting a new branch should be simple and seamless.

The gate reads the wrong branch: `on_main` is computed from `_get_current_branch()` (`cli.py:2233`) while gitbetter's positional `branch_name` is what declares the destination. Story Q.u already built the correct behavior — `_presume_committed_on_branch`'s anchor and no-anchor heuristics — and it is merely unreachable from `main`. Nothing new needs inventing.

- [x] Make the gate consult the destination: a supplied `branch_name` selects the `_presume_committed_on_branch` path regardless of which branch is checked out (`cli.py:2233-2240`) — now `cli.py:2249-2253`, a single `heading_elsewhere` predicate OR-ed into the existing branch test. Nothing new was invented: Q.u's heuristics were already correct and merely unreachable
- [x] Settle boundary case 1 — `branch_name` equal to the current branch (`git-push "msg" main` while on `main`) is **not** branch work and keeps the strict discipline
- [x] Settle boundary case 2 — the presumption announcements name the branch whose log was actually **scanned** (the current one); the destination branch has no log yet, so quoting it would mislead — satisfied structurally by passing `branch` rather than `branch_name` into the helper, with a test asserting the destination name is *absent* from the announcement
- [x] Leave out-of-sequence detection unchanged on `main` with no branch argument — the relaxation must be reachable only by explicitly naming a destination
- [x] Tests: kickoff from a squash-merged `main` with zero parseable IDs (no-anchor offer, not a whole-file bundle); kickoff with a partial anchor (presumption, not a hard error); same-branch argument keeps strict discipline; existing non-main behavior unchanged — 8 new tests (873 passed total)
- [x] Verification per CI-gate parity — `pyve test`, ruff, mypy, plus the stripped-`PATH` run — 873 both directions, ruff clean, mypy clean

**The equal-names rule cuts one way only.** `git-push main` while on `main` stays strict (boundary case 1), but `git-push feature/x` while *on* `feature/x` must keep relaxing — it was relaxed before this story by the non-main test, and it is the ordinary push-this-branch invocation. The predicate is therefore OR-ed into the existing check rather than replacing it, and a test pins the mirror case so a future "simplification" to a single equal-names rule fails loudly.

**An undeterminable branch stays strict.** Git absent, not a repo, or no commits yet: Q.u folded this into the strict side and it stays there even with a destination named. The relaxation works by scanning the current branch's log and presuming around what it shows, so it needs both a branch to scan and a name to quote — with neither, there is nothing to relax *against*. This also keeps the `assert branch is not None` at the call site honest, which mypy checks.

**One existing test changed shape, not intent.** `test_git_push_bundle_offer_branch_name_pass_through` pushed to `feature/xyz` from `main` with an empty log — which is now exactly the kickoff case, so the no-anchor offer lands ahead of the bundle offer it was written to exercise. It answers `n` then `y` and asserts the same pass-through. That it broke at all is the fix working: the old flow reached a whole-file bundle from a plain branch argument.

**Verified on a real repo, against real gitbetter.** A scratch repo whose history is one squash-merge-shaped subject (`Add feature X (#42)`) plus one intact `A.b: v0.2.0 Second`, with three `[Done]` stories — the exact reported situation. Three runs from `main`: **no argument** → the out-of-sequence hard error (unchanged); **`git-push feature/x`** → `The first committed story in branch 'main' is: A.b.`, `Presuming earlier [Done] stories merged to main via a squashed branch: A.a.`, and gitbetter opens with `Message: A.c: v0.3.0 Third` — the single correct story rather than a bundle spanning the file; **`git-push main`** → the out-of-sequence error again.

No version bump — Subphase R-3 ships bundled as `v2.21.0` at R.t.

### Story R.q: gitbetter `--keep` and `--amend` pass-through [Done]

Both wrappers build `argv = [tool_path, message]` plus an optional branch (`cli.py:2310`), so gitbetter's `--keep|-k` and `--amend` cannot be reached. `--keep` is exactly the multi-commit feature-branch flag — the convenience evaporates at the moment the workflow gets long enough to need it.

`--amend` means **commit the current tree on top of the old committed tree**, nothing more. Per the wrapper-value principle it is a short-circuit path, not a new branch through the derivation flow: no message is being decided, so none of the derivation machinery applies.

- [x] Add `--keep` / `-k` pass-through to both wrappers — no project-guide semantics attach to it (`cli.py:2573`)
- [x] Add `--amend` as a short-circuit path: read the previous subject with `git log -1 --pretty=%s` and pass it back **verbatim**. Do not re-derive from `stories.md` — that would rewrite a subject as a side effect of a bug fix, and would silently canonicalize legacy bundled subjects (permissive read / strict emit) — `_run_amend` (`cli.py:2309`), reached before the normal flow's early exits
- [x] Refuse `--amend` under `--no-input` (and `CI=1` / non-TTY stdin) with a non-zero exit — it force-pushes with `--force-with-lease`, and a history-shape decision is not a CI default
- [x] Refuse `--amend` when a `[Done]` story is uncommitted: gitbetter runs `git add -A` before amending (`git-push.sh:237`), so that story's work would land inside the previous story's commit under the previous story's message. Name the offending story in the refusal — **citation re-verified against the installed gitbetter 1.8.0** before building on it: `git add -A` at `libexec/git-push.sh:237`, `git commit --amend -m` at `:247`, `--force-with-lease` at `:291`
- [x] Scope the guard deliberately — it fires on `[Done]`-but-uncommitted stories only. In-progress work on a `[Planned]` story stays invisible to it; the wrapper does not become a general-purpose working-tree guard
- [x] Handle "no previous commit to amend" with a clear error rather than an opaque gitbetter failure
- [x] Confirm the normal already-committed → exit 0 `Nothing to commit` path is bypassed, not inverted — `--amend` should never reach it
- [x] Tests: `--keep` reaches gitbetter; `--amend` passes the previous subject unchanged; `--amend` refused under `--no-input`; refused with an uncommitted `[Done]` story; no-previous-commit error; both wrappers behave identically — 13 new tests (886 passed total)
- [x] Verification per CI-gate parity — 886 both directions, ruff clean, mypy clean

**The guard had to share the flow's notion of "committed", which the plan did not settle.** Finding 5 says detection "costs nothing" because the wrapper already computes the uncommitted `[Done]` list — but implemented against the **raw** committed set, the guard refuses on every feature branch whose earlier stories shipped under squashed PR titles. Those stories *are* committed; they just do not parse. That would make `--amend` unusable in exactly the workflow `--keep` and `--amend` exist to serve, and it would arrive as a mysterious refusal naming stories the developer shipped weeks ago. So the anchor computation was extracted from `_presume_committed_on_branch` into a pure `_presumed_squash_merged_prefix` (`cli.py:1950`) — no output, no prompting — and both the flow and the guard now read the same set through `_relaxed_committed_set` (`cli.py:2285`), which applies R.p's rule silently. Where there is no anchor to presume around, the guard stays strict: for a history-rewriting operation, refusing on ambiguity is the safe direction. A test pins the squash-merged case so the sharing cannot be undone by accident.

**Check order changed from the checklist's, on evidence.** The no-previous-commit test failed against the guard, not the code: in a repo with no commits *every* `[Done]` story is uncommitted, so the guard fired first and said "commit that story, then amend" — true, and a misdiagnosis. There is nothing to amend *into*. The subject read now precedes the guard, so the fresh-repo case gets the precise error. The `--no-input` refusal stays first: it is categorical and costs nothing to check.

**Verified against real gitbetter 1.8.0, including the part only a real run can show.** With `stories.md`'s title deliberately drifted from the commit's (`A.b: v0.2.0 Second, revised title` on disk vs. `A.b: v0.2.0 Second` in the log), gitbetter opened with `Message: A.b: v0.2.0 Second` and `Mode: amend` — the preserved subject, not the re-derived one, which is the whole of Finding 2 demonstrated rather than asserted. The three refusals were exercised through a pty (`script -q /dev/null`, since a non-TTY stdin trips the interactive-only rule first — itself a confirmation): fresh repo → `No previous commit to amend.`; `--no-input` → the force-push refusal; a finished-but-uncommitted `A.b` → `Refusing to amend: [Done] story A.b is not committed yet.` No history was rewritten in any run.

**`--keep` needed no design.** gitbetter parses flags positionally-independently (`git-push.sh:67-73`), so appending them after the message and optional branch is safe, and `--keep` composes with `--amend` and a branch argument in one invocation.

No version bump — Subphase R-3 ships bundled as `v2.21.0` at R.t.

### Story R.r: Widen completion staleness beyond the dead-path test [Done]

R.f defined **stale** as the dead-path test only (`os.access(path, os.X_OK)`) and flagged the gap in the same breath: a block generated by an older project-guide whose template has since changed is not detected, even though R.d's baked version stamp would make it detectable. R.h inherited the gap and re-flagged it as "the last story where it would naturally land." It did not land.

**The version stamp is the wrong predicate.** Comparing it to `__version__` would fire on every release, including the large majority that never touch the completion template — turning a precise signal into the noise R.h explicitly refused to risk. The question is "would reinstalling change anything?", which is a content comparison.

- [x] Recover the install parameters from the installed artifacts — `--bin` from the post-processed callback, and for zsh the autoload directory from the installed `fpath` line (R.f already does the latter) — **the plan's "unproven half" was already built**: `_baked_bin()` has recovered `--bin` since R.f, which is what the dead-path test reads. No spike was needed
- [x] Regenerate the script from those parameters and compare against what is installed; report **stale** on a genuine difference — `_content_drift` (`completion.py:715`), comparing **both** zsh artifacts: the autoload file carries the callback, the rc block carries the bootstrap, and either drifts alone. A block predating the bootstrap's "register explicitly when `compinit` already ran" fix wires up nothing while its autoload file looks perfect
- [x] Use R.d's version stamp **diagnostically** — name which version generated the block in the warning — never as the staleness decision
- [x] Keep the false-positive rate at zero: the warning fires from the pre-invoke hook ahead of every command, so a false positive is noise on every invocation. If exactness cannot be reached, warn **less** — that is the correct failure direction
- [x] Confirm `status` and `heal` stay consistent — both consume `inspect_shell`, so neither may disagree with the other about the same install — **they did not**, see below
- [x] Tests: template-drift staleness detected; a version bump that does not change the template does **not** warn; bare-name installs still report `installed` with the `PATH` note; existing dead-path and partial states unchanged — 15 new tests (901 passed total)
- [x] Verification per CI-gate parity — 901 both directions, ruff clean, mypy clean

**The provenance lines had to be excluded from the comparison, or the predicate becomes the one it replaced.** The bash artifact *is* the whole rc block, stamp included, so a body-vs-body compare would differ on every release — reintroducing exactly the noise the plan rejected. `_block_body` (`completion.py:660`) strips the sentinels and both provenance comments; `_stamped_version` reads the stamp separately, for the message only. A test drifts the stamp alone and asserts silence.

**`heal` was hard-coded to the old meaning of stale, and would have lied.** Its headline read `⚠ bash completion is stale: <path> is no longer executable`, which was safe while the dead-path test was the only way to be stale. With the widened predicate, a content-drifted block whose binary is perfectly live would have been announced as a dead file — a false statement pointing the developer at the wrong thing. `ShellStatus` gains a self-contained `reason` (`completion.py:607`) that `_classify` sets for both stale causes, and `heal` renders it instead of assuming. `status` is unaffected: it prints `details`, which was already per-cause. Caught by writing the consistency check the checklist asked for rather than reasoning that shared plumbing made it true.

**Regeneration turned inspection into a subprocess with a side effect — found by the R.m.1 stripped-`PATH` gate.** Click's bash generator calls `_check_version`, which shells out to `bash --norc -c 'echo $BASH_VERSION'` and prints *"Shell completion is not supported for Bash versions older than 4.4."* Two steady-state **silence** tests failed under `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, where `PATH` finds macOS system bash 3.2 — and `inspect_shell` runs from the pre-invoke hook ahead of every command, so that message would have become a line on every invocation for a large share of macOS users. The story would have *created* the noise it exists to remove. `_script_for_comparison` (`completion.py:694`) suppresses the message — right at install time, wrong during inspection, which is not an install request — and `lru_cache`s the result so the hook pays for at most one generation per process. Verified that Click returns byte-identical content either way, so the comparison stays environment-independent; an install that reads stale on one machine must not read current on another. Two tests pin the silence and the single generation. Worth noting this gate was added only one story earlier and has now caught a defect a normal-environment run could not see.

**Warn-less applied twice more.** A bare-name install bakes no `--bin`, so there is no parameter to regenerate from — it keeps reporting `installed` with its `PATH` note rather than comparing against a script nobody requested. And a block stamped *newer* than the running project-guide is left alone: two installs commonly coexist (a pyve toolchain copy and a project-local one — the subject of Subphase Q-4), and when the older inspects the newer's block, "stale" is backwards, since reinstalling would downgrade it. The stamp suppresses there without ever being what fires. The dead-path test also keeps priority when both conditions hold, because naming the dead binary is the more actionable sentence.

**Verified against real artifacts.** A real `completion install` into scratch rc files: fresh install → `installed`; editing the callback *and* the stamp → `stale`, `the installed script differs from the one this version generates`, `the installed block was generated by project-guide v2.14.0`; re-running `install` → `installed` again, so the remedy the message names is the one that works. Changing only the stamp → `installed` (the release-noise case). For zsh, drifting the bootstrap while leaving the autoload file pristine → `stale`, `the rc block differs from the one this version generates`.

No version bump — Subphase R-3 ships bundled as `v2.21.0` at R.t.

### Story R.s: Refactor planning docs (artifact-role realignment + spec accuracy) [Done]

Two problems surfaced while scoping a documentation refactor.

**Artifact roles have blurred.** `project-essentials.md` has accreted full behavioral and implementation contracts that belong in `features.md` (*what the system guarantees*) and `tech-spec.md` (*how it is built*). It is meant to be a map of where the skeletons are buried, not a description of each skeleton. Because its content is injected verbatim into every rendered `go.md`, the cost is paid in every mode: the file is 36,075 bytes — **50% of `go.md`'s 71,468** — and the `git-push` section alone is 10,484 bytes (15% of every `go.md`), describing in algorithmic detail a command the LLM is explicitly forbidden to initiate. Roughly 130 of its 213 lines duplicate content that already has a proper home. Relocate them; keep only the must-know facts and the pointers.

**`features.md` and `tech-spec.md` have drifted from the code.** FR-15 still documents the pre-v2.9.0 `git-push` error model, `features.md` contradicts itself on `go.md` tracking status, and both files carry stale inventories.

Verified against the code, the bundled template tree, and a full test run (636 passed, 91.51% coverage).

**Status — ON HOLD until R.p–R.r land.** Deliberately parked at the end of the phase: the subphases ahead of it change the very surfaces this story documents, so refactoring them first would guarantee a second pass. Concretely — Subphase R-1 rewrote FR-7 and added a `completion` command group to `features.md` / `tech-spec.md`, and R-1's own release story (R.i) removed the "Known limitations" block this story's `features.md` pass added. R-1 and R-2 have since shipped; the remaining blockers are R.p–R.r, which change `git-push` / `git-commit` behavior (FR-15, § External CLI Dependencies) and the completion staleness definition (FR-7). Run this **last**, once they have landed.

The `features.md` pass is already complete and was presented at its per-document gate; `docs/specs/features_old.md` is the backup and can be deleted once the whole session closes. The `tech-spec.md` pass and the `project-essentials.md` revisit have not started — the relocation targets they were to receive are named in their task lines below. Resume with `project-guide mode refactor_plan`.

Renumbered `R.b` → `R.?` → **`R.s`**, absorbed into Subphase R-3 (2026-08-12). It was previously a **phase-level** story belonging to no subphase, which created a problem its own text could not solve: it declares "rides the next code story's release," but as a phase-level story sitting *after* R-3's release tag there would be no next code story to ride. R-3 is the last subphase, so placing it after R.r satisfies "run this last, once every subphase has landed" exactly, and it now rides `v2.21.0`. It must run **after** R.p–R.r, which change the very `features.md` / `tech-spec.md` surfaces it reconciles.

- [x] **(confirmed — audited item by item, not taken on trust)** Refactor `features.md` — receive relocated *what* content (FR-15 branch-logic decision table: the 9 outcomes with exit codes, prompts, defaults, and `--no-input` behavior; `heal`/`update`/`init` division of labor into FR-14); fix the pre-v2.9.0 FR-15 error model; resolve the `go.md` tracked-vs-untracked self-contradiction (L132 / L140 vs FR-14 L395 — `tech-spec.md` L111 is the correct statement); add the missing `init` inputs `--test-first` and `--project-name`; add `developer/python-editable-install.md` and `templates/modes/_phase-letters.md` to the File Structure tree; add the missing `project_name` field to the `.project-guide.yml` schema block; refresh stale version examples; move `FR-7: Shell Completion` back into numeric sequence (it sat after FR-15); record FR-7's known zsh `compinit` / `PATH`-resolution limitations and point at the incoming [`shell-completion-ownership.md`](shell-completion-ownership.md) change request; repair the `phase-q-pyve-toolchain-hosting.md` link (moved to `.archive/`)
- [x] Refactor `tech-spec.md` — receive relocated *how* content (gitbetter wrapper internals under § External CLI Dependencies: bundled-subject emit grammar, colon rule, whitespace collapse, the permissive-read/strict-emit parser asymmetry, header-filter predicate, committed-prefix→uncommitted-suffix partition, `_presume_committed_on_branch` anchor heuristics; reconcile rather than duplicate for gitignore / IDE-visibility / auto-heal-hook / schema-versioning detail already partly present); fix the entry-point template misnamed `templates/go.md` → `templates/llm_entry_point.md`; update the test inventory 629 → 636 in both places; extend the partials filename convention to cover `_phase-letters.md` — plus R.p/R.q's additions (destination-aware gate, `--amend` short-circuit, the wrapper-value principle) since those landed after this story was scoped
- [x] Revisit `project-essentials.md` — trim ~213 lines to ~80 by relocating the ~130 duplicated lines above; retain the developer-lane rule, the genuinely non-obvious traps, the Pyve env-spec vendored contract (no other home), and pointers into `features.md` / `tech-spec.md`; verify no fact is lost in transit — **224 → 108 lines, 37,992 → 16,045 bytes (−58%)**

**The measured payoff is in `go.md`, which is the point.** `project-essentials.md` is injected verbatim into every rendered guide in every mode, so its weight is paid on every invocation: `go.md` went from **469 lines / 64,112 bytes to 353 lines / 42,165 bytes — 21,947 bytes off every render**. The `git-push` section alone was 10,546 bytes describing, in algorithmic detail, a command the LLM is explicitly forbidden to initiate; what remains is the rule that it must not, plus two pointers.

**The story's own numbers were stale, and worth recording as a pattern.** It was scoped at 213 lines / 36,075 bytes; the file had grown to **224 / 37,992** because R.m.1 added the CI-parity block and R.o amended invariant (b) — both landed *during* the hold this story was waiting out. A doc-refactor story parked behind implementation work should expect its targets to have moved; re-measure before quoting. The 108-line result is above the ~80 target for the same reason: the CI-parity block and the R-2/R-3 invariants are new must-know content that did not exist at scoping time, and none of it has another home.

**Task 1 was audited rather than trusted.** The `[x] (confirm this)` marker meant the `features.md` pass claimed completion without verification. Checked item by item: FR-7 is back in numeric sequence (it had sat after FR-15), FR-15 carries the 9-outcome decision table, the `go.md` tracked-vs-untracked self-contradiction is resolved with all statements now agreeing on *unignored but untracked*, both missing `init` inputs are listed, both File Structure entries are present, and the `phase-q-pyve-toolchain-hosting.md` link points into `.archive/`. Confirmed.

**Two more drifted specs were found and fixed, beyond the checklist.** `tech-spec.md` documented `_get_committed_story_ids()` as extracting IDs via a single regex `^([A-Z]\.[a-z]+):\s` — a shape Story P.u retired in favor of `parse_committed_ids_from_subject`, and which returns a tuple, not a set. And `_run_gitbetter_wrapper`'s signature omitted R.q's `keep` / `amend`. Both are exactly the "drifted from the code" class the story exists to close, so both were corrected in passing.

**Nothing was lost in transit — verified by audit, not assumption.** Every deleted section was checked for a destination before removal: the gitignore block history, IDE-LLM visibility, the `heal`/`update`/`init` division of labor, and the `heal` auto-yes notice were already in `features.md` FR-14/FR-8; the auto-heal hook contract was already in `tech-spec.md`. A grep sweep for individually-deleted facts then caught **three with no home anywhere** — the `archive-stories` cwd-vs-`project_name` drift warning, the deliberate absence of a migration registry, and its YAGNI rationale — which were written into `tech-spec.md` rather than dropped. The `--no-input` contract for future prompts (the pinned `_require_setting` message, the intentional `# noqa: F841`) moved to `tech-spec.md` § Auto-Heal Group Hook, leaving a one-line trap behind.

**A rendering-specific trap the trim introduced and then removed.** Markdown links like `[features.md](features.md)` are correct in `docs/specs/` and **broken** in the injected copy, which lives at `docs/project-guide/go.md` — a different directory. Pointers are therefore written as plain paths, with the reason recorded in the file so the next editor does not "improve" them back into links. The pre-existing `../../.github/workflows/ci.yml` links are safe: both directories sit at the same depth.

`docs/specs/features_old.md` remains as the backup; R.t deletes it.

`concept.md` needs no changes — its scope list, command inventory, and 17-mode count with the `plan_envs` frozen marker are all current.

No version bump — Subphase R-3 ships bundled as `v2.21.0` at R.t, which owns the CHANGELOG entry.

---

### Story R.t: `v2.21.0` Subphase R-3 bundled release [Done]

Documentation and the single release tag for the subphase.

- [x] Update `features.md` FR-15 — the destination-aware branch gate, the `--keep` / `--amend` flags with both refusal conditions, and the wrapper-value principle that bounds what the wrapper will ever do — the decision table's branch column is now **strict / suspended** rather than main/non-main, since the checkout stopped being what decides it
- [x] Update `features.md` FR-7 — the widened staleness definition; the known-gaps block keeps fish, bash 3.2 `compopt`, and PowerShell, and gains the Windows/git-bash deferral — the "staleness is a dead-path test only" gap is **removed from the list**, since R.r closed it
- [x] Update `tech-spec.md` § External CLI Dependencies — the destination-aware gate, `--amend`'s short-circuit path, and why it is not an inversion of the already-committed check — **already delivered by R.s**, verified rather than rewritten
- [x] Update `project-essentials.md` § `project-guide git-push` is developer-lane — the branch-logic list gains the destination-aware case; record the wrapper-value principle as the rule future wrapper features are tested against — **superseded by R.s**: the branch-logic list was relocated wholesale to `tech-spec.md`, so there is no list here to extend. What remains is the developer-lane rule plus pointers, which is the correct end state and cheaper than the checklist assumed
- [x] Update `README.md` and `docs/site/user-guide/commands.md` for the two new flags — grep for every surface rather than working from a file list (the R.i lesson: the checklist named four files and there were five) — the lesson paid out again, see below
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` entry for `v2.21.0`, dated — Added / Changed / Fixed
- [x] Bump `project_guide/version.py` and `pyproject.toml` to `2.21.0`
- [x] Verification per CI-gate parity: `pyve test`, `pyve env run ruff check project_guide/ tests/`, `pyve env run mypy project_guide/`, the stripped-`PATH` run, and `mkdocs build --strict` — 901 passed both directions, ruff clean, mypy clean, mkdocs exit 0
- [x] Delete `docs/specs/features_old.md` — the R.s backup, no longer needed once that story closes

**Two checklist items were already satisfied, and saying so beats re-doing them.** R.s relocated the wrapper internals into `tech-spec.md` — including the destination-aware gate, `--amend`'s short-circuit with the explicit "not an inversion" reasoning, and the wrapper-value principle — because those surfaces were what it was reconciling. Item 4 is stranger: it asks to extend `project-essentials.md`'s branch-logic list, but R.s deleted that list on purpose, since an algorithmic description of a command the LLM may not initiate is exactly the content that file should not carry. Extending it would have undone the trim. Verified both against the current files rather than assuming.

**The R.i lesson paid out again — and found older debt than the flags.** A `grep -rl` for the wrapper names turned up **seven** surfaces where the checklist named two. Five needed nothing (test-inventory mentions, a rationale analogy in `_header-cycle.md` that R.p does not invalidate). The other two carried genuine drift, both **predating this subphase**:

- **`README.md`'s "Hard errors (exit 1)" list was two releases stale.** It still claimed *"the last `[Done]` story is already committed — resolve manually"* and *"multiple `[Done]` stories are uncommitted — commit them one at a time"*. Story P.u (v2.9.0) turned the second into a bundle offer, and P.v (v2.10.0) turned the first into an **exit 0**. The spec was corrected at the time; the README was not, so the user-facing document had been telling people that the tool's normal success path was a hard error for four minor versions. Rewritten to match, with the out-of-sequence and duplicate-ID errors that actually exist.
- **`production-github-guide.md` cited "the wrapper's regex"** — the single-regex parser Story P.u retired in favor of `parse_committed_ids_from_subject`. A bundled template, so the stale claim ships to every consumer.

**A gap in the site's developer docs, reported rather than silently fixed.** `docs/site/developer-guide/{testing,development,contributing}.md` carry per-file test tables that omit `test_completion.py` entirely — 149 tests, the largest single file after `test_cli.py`, added by Subphase R-1 and never added to those tables. Their other counts are approximate and also drifted. Correcting the developer-guide test inventory is a documentation story of its own, not a line item in a release story, so it is left for the developer to schedule rather than folded in here.

**Phase R is complete.** Four tags — `v2.18.1` (R.a), `v2.19.0` (R-1), `v2.20.0` (R-2), `v2.21.0` (R-3) — the documented multi-release exception, because the subphases were independently shippable fixes to unrelated surfaces.

**Release shape.** Phase R carries four tags — `v2.18.1` (R.a), `v2.19.0` (Subphase R-1), `v2.20.0` (Subphase R-2), `v2.21.0` (Subphase R-3) — the documented multi-release exception rather than the preferred single bundle, for the reason recorded in R-1 and R-2: the subphases are independently shippable fixes to unrelated surfaces.

### Story R.u: Render user-facing paths with forward slashes on every platform [Done]

Windows CI failed on `v2.21.0`'s commit. `init`'s detection-miss warning (Story R.m) interpolated a `Path` object, so on Windows it printed `docs\project-guide\go.md` while every other project-guide message printed `docs/project-guide/go.md`.

**A product defect, not a test defect.** The obvious reading is "the assertion hard-coded a POSIX separator, so relax the assertion." That is backwards. The project already has a convention — every other user-facing path is assembled as an f-string with a literal `/` (`f"{config.target_dir}/go.md"` in the tracked-`go.md` warning, `stories_md_display` in the wrappers) — and R.m's warning was the one place that departed from it. Relaxing the test would have preserved the inconsistency and taught the suite to accept it.

- [x] Add `_display_path()` (`cli.py:152`) — `Path(path).as_posix()`, with the convention and its rationale recorded once rather than repeated at each call site
- [x] Apply it to the detection-miss warning **and** to the P.o "intentionally untracked" note two lines below it, which had the same latent defect but no test asserting its path. Left alone, `init` would have named the same file two different ways in two consecutive lines on Windows
- [x] Tests that catch the bug **off** Windows: `PureWindowsPath` renders backslashes on every platform, so the regression test fails against a `str()`-based implementation on macOS and Linux too — verified by temporarily reverting the helper and watching it fail
- [x] A test asserting both `init` notices name `docs/project-guide/go.md` and that no backslash-separated form appears in stderr
- [x] Record the trap in `project-essentials.md` § Story verification — CI runs Windows, a local macOS run cannot see it, and the `PureWindowsPath` technique makes it reproducible
- [x] Fold the fix into the unreleased `v2.21.0` CHANGELOG entry under **Fixed**, rather than opening a new version section
- [x] Verification: 906 passed (901 + 5) both directions, ruff clean, mypy clean

**No version bump — this rides `v2.21.0`.** Neither `v2.20.0` nor `v2.21.0` is tagged or on PyPI (2.19.0 is the latest published), so the release carrying the defect has not shipped. Opening a `2.21.1` for a bug that never reached a user would put a patch line in the changelog for a version nobody could install. Checked rather than assumed, via `git tag` and `pip index versions`.

**The gap this exposes in the verification checklist.** The four local gates — tests, ruff, mypy, the stripped-`PATH` run — all passed on the commit Windows rejected, because every one of them runs on POSIX. The stripped-`PATH` gate added in R.m.1 closed the *environment* dimension (pyve present vs. absent); this is the *platform* dimension, and no local gate covers it. The mitigation is not another local run but a habit: assert the forward-slash form, and reproduce Windows rendering with `PureWindowsPath` where a message names a path.

### Story R.v: `v2.21.1` Read committed state from `stories.md` at `HEAD` [Done]

Reported from the field (pyve, 2026-08-22). On a squash-merged `main`, `project-guide git-push fix/P.ap-pyve-in-ci` proposed a ~500-character bundled subject covering **eight** stories — `P.ai` through `P.ap` — when exactly one, `P.ap`, was uncommitted. `P.ai`–`P.ao` had shipped through a squashed PR.

**The anchor reaches the wrong direction.** Story Q.u's presumption announces the *first* `[Done]` story whose ID parses out of the log and presumes everything **before** it merged (`_presumed_squash_merged_prefix` takes `committed_in_branch[0]` and presumes `commit_units[:anchor_idx]`). In the report the anchor was `P.af.3`, so the presumption covered `P.v`–`P.af.2` and the eight stories *after* the anchor fell into what FR-15 called the "genuinely uncommitted tail." Squash merges land at the **tip** of history, so the opaque region is always the recent tail — exactly what the anchor declares trustworthy. A *trailing* anchor fails identically: the squashed stories still follow the last parseable subject. The signal is not in the subject stream, because a squash merge is the thing that removed it.

**A squash merge destroys subjects; it preserves content.** Merging rewrites the subjects of the commits it absorbs, but it carries the `stories.md` those commits edited — the one that marks them `[Done]`. `HEAD`'s copy of that file therefore answers "did this ship?" with no subject surviving. This is a local, complete answer: no forge API, no dependence on GitHub's squash-body setting, immune to rebase and PR-title rewriting.

- [x] `parse_done_story_ids(text)` in `stories.py` — the content-addressed counterpart to `_read_done_stories`, which reads a path; the R.v revision exists only inside git
- [x] `_get_head_done_story_ids()` (`cli.py`) — `git show HEAD:./<spec_artifacts_path>/stories.md`. The leading `./` makes git resolve against the cwd rather than the repo root, so the wrapper still works from a subdirectory
- [x] Union it into `committed` in `_run_gitbetter_wrapper`, immediately after the duplicate check so every downstream consumer reads the result. **Union, never replace** — subjects remain the only signal that can name a bundled commit, and the sole input to the duplicate-ID warning
- [x] Same union in `_run_amend`'s staging guard, which computes its own set and had the identical blind spot: a story squash-merged after the anchor read as uncommitted, so `--amend` refused with "that work would land inside the previous commit" about work already in `main`. `spec_artifacts_path` threaded through to reach it
- [x] Degradation is silence, not error: git absent, non-repository cwd, empty repo, or untracked `stories.md` → empty set → exactly the pre-R.v behavior
- [x] Five tests. The headline reproduces the report minimized (anchor parses, a later story squash-merged, one genuinely uncommitted); plus the fully-merged steady state (→ `Nothing to commit`, where the no-anchor prompt could only ever guess "the last one"), the degradation path, the `HEAD:./` path form, and the `--amend` guard
- [x] Verified both directions — with the fix neutralized, 4 of the 5 fail (the degradation test asserts pre-R.v behavior, so it must pass either way)
- [x] `features.md` FR-15 gains "What counts as committed" and the backwards-only correction; `tech-spec.md` § External CLI Dependencies gains the two-source union, the subject-vs-content table, the `HEAD:./` rationale, and a do-not-move-the-anchor note
- [x] Verification: 911 passed (906 + 5), ruff clean, mypy clean, stripped-`PATH` run 911 passed

**Version — `v2.21.1`, correcting a stale premise in R.u.** R.u recorded that "neither `v2.20.0` nor `v2.21.0` is tagged or on PyPI," which was true when written. Both have since happened: `v2.21.0` is tagged at R.u's own commit and published (checked via `git tag` and `pip index versions`, not assumed). The defect is in shipped code and this is a bug fix, so it takes its own patch line rather than riding an already-released version.

**Prevention scan.** The root-cause pattern is "derive committed state from commit subjects." Both call sites of `_get_committed_story_ids()` are fixed. `status` reads `stories.md` only and never consults git, so it has no exposure. The `Future` § "Story tracker" entry is updated below — its premise was correct about the subject-scanning architecture and is now narrower.

**What this does not fix.** The signal assumes a story's `[Done]` flip lands in the same commit as its work — enforced in practice by gitbetter staging the whole tree, but a `[Done]` flip committed *ahead* of its work reads as shipped. And the wrapper still cannot attribute *multiple* genuinely-uncommitted stories to separate commits; it proposes a bundle. Also observed in the report and left alone: the bundled subject has no length sanity check, so a legitimate 8-story bundle emits ~500 characters.

---

## Future

### Story tracker [Deferred]

There is no reasonable way to track which stories should be added to the commit message when a branch is being committed on a repo with the main branch locked. When there are multiple stories marked `[Done]` but one or more were already committed, squashed, and merged. This really needs a story service that tracks each commit as well as the commit hash. The `stories.md` file should instead be converted into an interface between the developer and story service, scanning it for human or LLM-added updates. This could be a SQLite DB or a hierarchical directory and file system tracked in git (straightforward). It could also be git-ignored and track only a zip copy (clever, complicated). Tracking what is active could keep an `.archive` directly to clearly mark a branch of stories that are either cancelled or completed so the surface to scan for updates remains smaller.

**Narrowed by Story R.v (2026-08-22), not resolved.** The premise above was accurate about the subject-scanning architecture: a squash merge rewrites the subjects the wrapper reconstructs from, and no heuristic over `git log --pretty=%s` recovers them. R.v answers the *detection* half without a service, by reading a signal the squash preserves — `stories.md` at `HEAD` already marks the merged stories `[Done]`. That is the cheapest form of the "convert `stories.md` into the interface" idea in this entry: the file already is the record, so nothing new has to be stored.

Three things a service would still buy, none of which R.v provides:

- **Commit hashes.** Nothing records *which* commit carried a story, so there is no way to link a story to its diff, detect a story whose commit was reverted, or attribute a story across a rebase.
- **Multi-story attribution.** With several genuinely-uncommitted `[Done]` stories the wrapper still proposes one bundled subject; splitting them into separate commits with correct per-story messages needs per-story state the file does not carry.
- **A bounded scan surface.** The `.archive` idea stands on its own — `archive_stories` already exists and already shrinks the surface; the gap is that nothing prompts for it on a release boundary.

Revisit if hash-level attribution becomes concrete. The detection bug that motivated this entry is fixed.

### Shell completion on Windows — support git-bash properly, or refuse [Deferred]

Recommended as a follow-on by Story R.i and considered for Subphase R-3, where it was **dropped during out-of-scope negotiation** (2026-08-12). The `completion` command group bakes Windows-convention paths into POSIX shell scripts, which is wrong for git-bash/MSYS — the only plausible Windows consumer. Two candidate outcomes, and the choice is the deliverable:

- **Support it** — detect MSYS/git-bash and emit POSIX-convention paths. Additive and non-breaking.
- **Refuse** — error clearly on Windows rather than installing something wrong. Honest, but breaks any git-bash user who works today, which would make it a substantively breaking change and force a major bump.

**Why deferred rather than planned:** neither outcome can be validated without a Windows machine, so committing to one now is guessing — the same reason R.i declined to guess. The gap is already documented in three places (FR-7 known gaps, `install-options.md`, the `v2.19.0` CHANGELOG), all stating that bash/zsh completion is macOS- and Linux-supported and unverified on Windows. Nothing has been reported from the field. Revisit when a Windows consumer surfaces or a test machine is available.

### Installation/Config Discovery Hierarchy (global vs. project context) [Deferred]

Model after `asdf` with no `.tool-versions`: context-free commands still work; project-scoped commands warn when there's no project. Today `project-guide` resolves its operating context only from a local `.project-guide.yml` in `Path.cwd()`, so commands run outside a project directory have no context and the pre-invoke hook stays silent (e.g., the Q-4 local-install readiness warning can't fire without a local config). Support a discovery hierarchy with a graceful global fallback:

- **Context-free commands** (`--version`, `status`, …) run against the global pyve toolchain-install context when no local `.project-guide.yml` is found — no project home required.
- **Project-scoped commands** (`mode`, …) warn "no project home" (no-op / non-zero exit) when no local `.project-guide.yml` is found, rather than silently doing nothing.

Resolution order: local `.project-guide.yml` first, then the global toolchain-install context. **Cross-repo contract implication:** the install-location-independence contract (Story Q.l, pinned by `tests/test_cross_repo_contract.py`) currently mandates per-project state is *always* resolved from `cwd`, never from the package install location — a global fallback is a coordinated evolution of that contract requiring a paired Pyve story (the global toolchain context is Pyve-owned). Defer until the need is concrete.

### Audit Modes [Deferred]

Future modes: `audit_security`, `audit_architecture`, `audit_performance`, `audit_best_practices`, `audit_modularity`, `audit_patterns`.

### Project Lifecycle Automation [Deferred]

- Release helper / version-bump / tag automation — developer works across multiple git flows and prefers tool-agnostic; no timeline.
- Migration tooling for `docs/guides/` → `docs/project-guide/` — future `refactor` mode; low demand.

### Advanced Project Essentials [Deferred]

- `create_or_modify` action type — revisit if multiple artifacts develop the need; not yet justified.
- Validation/linting of `project-essentials.md` content — freeform by design; template convention is sufficient.
- Auto-detection of stale `project-essentials.md` — git-log based; deferred until there is demand.

### CLI Edge Cases [Deferred]

- `--interactive` flag to force interactive mode over non-TTY stdin — not needed; `stdin` can always be re-attached.
- Legacy broken-state detection for `init` (`.project-guide.yml` absent but target dir populated) — unusual edge case; falls through to existing skip-with-warnings path.

### Integrity & Validation [Deferred]

- `project-guide check` command — dedicated integrity/audit surface with nonzero exit on failure, suitable for CI and pre-commit hooks. Candidate rules: `project_name` in config vs. `cwd.name` vs. `pyproject.toml` `[project] name`; artifact headers (`# stories.md -- <name> (<lang>)`) vs. `config.project_name`/`config.programming_language`; `SCHEMA_VERSION` surfacing; `installed_version` vs. `__version__`; `.archive/stories-vX.Y.Z.md` filenames parse cleanly; metadata override keys reference existing modes; unrendered `{{ var }}` placeholders across written artifacts (broadens the N.s `render_fresh_stories_artifact` guard to every written artifact). `project-guide status` runs a cheap subset and prints a one-line footer (`⚠ N integrity issues — run 'project-guide check' for details`) without changing its exit code. Precedent: `django check`, `brew doctor`, `cargo check`. Defer until there is a concrete second integrity rule worth shipping (N.s covers the first drift source inline with a warning).

### Template & Rendering [Deferred]

- Support for literal `{{ var }}` strings in template output — use `{% raw %}...{% endraw %}` on a case-by-case basis; bridge with a general solution only if the pattern becomes common.

### mypy `tests.*` unused-override cleanup [Deferred]

`mypy project_guide/` emits `note: unused section(s): module = ['tests.*']` on every run — the `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` block targeting `tests.*` in `pyproject.toml` matches nothing, because the checked target is `project_guide/` only (tests are never passed to mypy). Harmless (a note, not an error — exit stays 0 on success) but it's noise on every type-check, and a dead config stanza invites confusion about whether tests are meant to be type-checked. Resolve by deciding intent, then either: (a) **remove** the dead `tests.*` override from `pyproject.toml` (if tests are intentionally out of mypy's scope), or (b) **bring `tests/` into the mypy target** (CI step + local convention) if the override implies test type-checking was once intended. Surfaced 2026-06-11 during the Q.u mypy CI fix. Low priority — cosmetic until someone wants test type-checking.
