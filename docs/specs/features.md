# features.md — project-guide (Python)

This document defines **what** the `project-guide` project does — requirements, inputs, outputs, behavior — without specifying **how** it is implemented. This is the source of truth for scope.

For a high-level concept (why), see [`concept.md`](concept.md). For implementation details (how), see [`tech-spec.md`](tech-spec.md). For a breakdown of the implementation plan (step-by-step tasks), see [`stories.md`](stories.md). For project-specific must-know facts that future LLMs need to avoid blunders, see [`project-essentials.md`](project-essentials.md). For the workflow steps tailored to the current mode (cycle steps, approval gates, conventions), see [`docs/project-guide/go.md`](../project-guide/go.md) — re-read it whenever the mode changes or after context compaction.

## Project Goal

`project-guide` is a Python CLI tool that installs a mode-driven template system into software projects, providing structured LLM workflows for planning, coding, debugging, and documentation. Each mode renders a single entry-point document (`go.md`) that the LLM reads to begin collaborating with the developer.

### Core Requirements

1. **Mode-Driven Templates**: Define development workflows as modes, each with its own template, prerequisites, and completion criteria
2. **Dynamic Rendering**: Render a single entry-point document (`go.md`) from Jinja2 templates based on the active mode
3. **Project Initialization**: Install the full template system into any project with a single command
4. **File Synchronization**: Keep installed templates current with the latest package version using content-hash comparison
5. **Override Management**: Allow developers to lock specific files when they contain project-specific customizations
6. **Status Reporting**: Show mode, prerequisites, and file sync state at a glance

### Operational Requirements

1. **CLI Interface**: Intuitive commands for init, mode, status, update, override, purge
2. **Configuration**: Project-specific settings stored in `.project-guide.yml`
3. **Safety**: Never overwrite files without explicit consent; backups created on forced updates
4. **Transparency**: Compact status output with grouped sections; verbose mode for details
5. **Idempotency**: Running the same command multiple times produces the same result
6. **Shell Completion**: Tab completion for command names, flags, and mode names (bash, zsh, fish)

### Quality Requirements

1. **Reliability**: Never corrupt or lose project-specific file customizations
2. **Clarity**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance (e.g., "Run `project-guide update` to sync")
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: click, jinja2, pyyaml, packaging — no heavy frameworks
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
5. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% code coverage; parametrized test renders every mode

### Usability Requirements

1. **Primary Users**: Developers using LLM assistance for software projects
2. **Installation**: `pip install project-guide`
3. **Zero Config**: Works with sensible defaults; no configuration required for basic use
4. **Fast Autocomplete**: Short filenames (`go.md`, not `go-project-guide.md`) for IDE/LLM autocomplete

### Non-goals

1. **Not a project scaffolding tool** — manages workflow documentation, not project structure (though `scaffold_project` mode guides the LLM through scaffolding)
2. **Not a code generator** — provides structure for the LLM to follow; code is generated conversationally
3. **Not an LLM API client** — no API calls; the LLM reads rendered markdown documents
4. **Not language-specific** — default templates assume Python but modes are language-agnostic

## Inputs

### Command Line

**`project-guide init`**
- Optional: `--target-dir` (default: `docs/project-guide`)
- Optional: `--force` (overwrite existing files)
- Optional: `--no-input` (skip stdin; auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY)
- Optional: `--test-first` (prefer TDD; planning modes suggest `code_test_first`, persisted as `test_first` in `.project-guide.yml`)
- Optional: `--quiet` / `-q` (machine mode: **no stdout on success**; errors/warnings on stderr — see FR-9)
- Optional: `--project-name` (name used in generated artifacts, e.g. the `stories.md` header; first step of the resolution chain — CLI flag → `PROJECT_GUIDE_PROJECT_NAME` → `pyproject.toml` `[project].name` → current directory name)
- Optional: `--pyve-version` (pyve's version, supplied by a host tool that already knows it; skips the `pyve --version` probe entirely and renders the Pyve guidance — CLI flag → `PYVE_VERSION` → `PATH` probe. **`init` only:** later changes are handled by re-detection on `update` / `mode`, not by more flags — see FR-13)

**`project-guide mode [MODE_NAME]`**
- Optional: mode name to switch to
- No argument: list modes grouped by category with ✓/✗/→ markers; interactive numbered menu on TTY
- Optional: `--verbose` / `-v` (show unmet prerequisite file paths)
- Optional: `--no-input` (show listing only, skip interactive menu)

**`project-guide status`**
- Optional: `--verbose` / `-v` (show full per-file list and per-phase story breakdown)

**`project-guide update`**
- Optional: `--files` (specific files to update)
- Optional: `--dry-run` (show what would change without applying)
- Optional: `--force` (update even overridden/modified files, creates backups)
- Optional: `--no-input` (non-interactive; reserved for future prompts)
- Optional: `--quiet` / `-q` (machine mode: **no stdout on success**; errors/warnings on stderr — see FR-9)

**`project-guide heal`**
- Optional: `--no-input` (auto-yes the `[Y/n]` prompt; emit a one-line stderr notice when writes occur — auto-enabled by `CI=1`, `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1`, or non-TTY stdin)

**`project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]`**
- Optional positional `BRANCH_NAME` — passed through to gitbetter's `git-push` for branch-aware push flows
- No other flags — the wrapped command is fully interactive (preview, confirm, branch cleanup, reject/recovery menu), so `--no-input` / `--quiet` would be no-ops; for those, route through raw `git-push` instead

**`project-guide git-commit [BRANCH_NAME]`**
- Identical interface and behavior to `git-push` (FR-15), but invokes gitbetter's `git-commit` for a local commit instead of a push

**`project-guide override FILE_NAME REASON`**
- Required: file name (template-relative path)
- Required: reason for override

**`project-guide unoverride FILE_NAME`**
- Required: file name

**`project-guide overrides`**
- No arguments

**`project-guide purge`**
- Optional: `--force` (skip confirmation prompt)
- Optional: `--no-input` (skip stdin; auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY)
- Optional: `--quiet` / `-q` (machine mode: **no stdout on success**; errors/warnings on stderr — see FR-9)

### Configuration File

**`.project-guide.yml`** (created in project root):
```yaml
version: '2.0'              # config schema version, not the package version
installed_version: 2.20.0
target_dir: docs/project-guide
metadata_file: .metadata.yml
current_mode: default
test_first: false
project_name: my-project
pyve_version: 3.2.2         # bare version; the legacy raw `pyve --version` line still reads
pyve_installed: true        # the render gate for the Pyve guidance — see FR-13
```

`version` tracks the **config schema** (`SCHEMA_VERSION` in `config.py`) and bumps only on breaking changes — a field rename, removal, type change, or a change in an existing field's meaning. Additive-with-default fields (every field below `current_mode` above) do not bump it, because `Config.load` reads each through `data.get(key, default)` and an older config keeps loading unchanged.

### Metadata File

**`.metadata.yml`** (inside target directory, hidden):
- Defines all modes, their templates, artifacts, prerequisites, and shared variables
- `common` block provides variable substitution across all mode definitions
- Installed by `init`, synced by `update`

---

## Outputs

### File Structure

**After `project-guide init`:**

Only `.project-guide.yml` (config) is **tracked** in the consumer repo. Everything under `docs/project-guide/` is gitignored static bundled data — re-populated by `heal` on first invocation in a fresh clone (Phase P, FR-14) — **except** `docs/project-guide/go.md`, which is **unignored but untracked by default** (v2.8.0 / Story P.o).

Those two properties are independent and both load-bearing:

- **Unignored** because IDE-integrated LLMs (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) typically hide gitignored files from the LLM's view, and the instruction to `Read docs/project-guide/go.md` requires the file to be visible.
- **Untracked** because a tracked `go.md` churns in every mode-switch diff and causes `git switch` to abort when a feature branch's tip differs from its base.

See FR-14 for the migration path and the `heal` warning that surfaces a still-tracked `go.md`.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Mode-Driven Template Rendering

The system renders a single entry-point document (`go.md`) from Jinja2 templates based on the active mode.

**Behavior:**
1. Entry-point template (`templates/llm_entry_point.md`) includes `_header-common.md` and the active mode's template
2. Mode template includes the appropriate header partial (`_header-sequence.md` or `_header-cycle.md`)
3. Context variables from `.metadata.yml` common block are available in all templates
4. `target_dir` is passed as a Jinja2 context variable
5. Undefined variables render as placeholders (lenient mode), not errors

**Modes (17 total):**

| Mode | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `default` | sequence | Project lifecycle overview for new users |
| `scaffold_project` | sequence | Scaffold LICENSE, headers, manifest, README, CHANGELOG |
| `plan_concept` | sequence | Define problem and solution space |
| `plan_features` | sequence | Define feature requirements |
| `plan_tech_spec` | sequence | Define technical specification |
| `plan_envs` | sequence | Define named environments and their dependencies **(frozen — pending Pyve work; do not use)** |
| `plan_stories` | sequence | Break down into implementation stories |
| `plan_phase` | sequence | Add a new feature phase to an existing project |
| `plan_production_phase` | sequence | Plan a production-grade phase post-1.0 with readiness checklist and breaking-change negotiation |
| `archive_stories` | sequence | Archive completed stories.md and start fresh for next phase |
| `code_direct` | cycle | Fast coding workflow with commit-per-story |
| `code_test_first` | cycle | Test-driven development workflow |
| `debug` | cycle | Reproduce, isolate, fix, verify workflow |
| `document_brand` | sequence | Define brand descriptions and messaging |
| `document_landing` | sequence | Generate landing page and MkDocs docs |
| `refactor_plan` | cycle | Update planning artifacts for new features or migration |
| `refactor_document` | cycle | Update documentation artifacts for new features or migration |

### FR-2: Project Initialization

`project-guide init` installs the complete template system into a project.

**Behavior:**
1. Copy template tree from package to target directory (default: `docs/project-guide`)
2. Render `go.md` in `default` mode
3. Create `.project-guide.yml` with current version, target directory, metadata file path, and `default` mode
4. Write the canonical `# project-guide` block to `.gitignore` (negation-free explicit-list form: ignore every top-level entry under `target_dir` except `go.md`, plus a `<target>/**/*.bak.*` catch-all — the LLM reads `go.md` and IDE-integrated LLMs hide gitignored files from the LLM's view; see FR-14)
5. Report number of files installed

**Edge Cases:**
- `.project-guide.yml` exists → error unless `--force`
- Files already exist → skip without `--force`, overwrite with `--force`

### FR-3: File Synchronization (Hash-Based)

`project-guide update` syncs installed files to the latest package templates using content-hash comparison.

**Behavior:**
1. For each tracked file, compare SHA-256 hash of installed file vs bundled template
2. Hash matches → current (no action)
3. Hash differs and not overridden → prompt user to backup and overwrite
4. File missing → create it
5. File overridden → skip (unless `--force`)
6. After updating template files, re-render `go.md` for the current mode
7. Update `installed_version` in config

**Key design decision:** Version numbers do not determine freshness. A package version bump that doesn't change a specific template will not flag that file as needing an update.

**Edge Cases:**
- `--dry-run` → show changes without applying
- `--force` → backup and overwrite modified/overridden files without prompting
- `--files` → sync only specific files

### FR-4: Override Management

`project-guide override` locks a file from updates.

**Behavior:**
1. Verify file exists in tracked file list
2. Record override in `.project-guide.yml` with reason, locked version, and date
3. `update` skips overridden files unless `--force`

`project-guide unoverride` removes the lock.

`project-guide overrides` lists all overridden files with reasons.

### FR-5: Status Reporting

`project-guide status` shows a compact, grouped summary.

**Sections:**
1. **Header**: package version; installed version shown only when it differs
2. **Mode**: current mode name and description; prerequisites when applicable; hint to list modes
3. **Guide**: rendered entry-point path; onboarding hint
4. **Files**: summary counts (current, need updating, missing, overridden); `--verbose` for per-file list; hint to update when needed
5. **Stories** (when `stories.md` exists and contains stories): total/done/in-progress/planned counts; next unstarted story; `--verbose` adds per-phase breakdown

**Styling:** Bold labels, cyan highlights for mode name and guide path, color-coded file counts (green/yellow/red), dim action prompts.

### FR-6: Purge

`project-guide purge` removes all project-guide files.

**Behavior:**
1. Show what will be removed (config file and target directory)
2. Confirm unless `--force`
3. Remove target directory and config file

### FR-7: Shell Completion

Tab completion for `project-guide` commands, flags, and mode names, installed and owned by project-guide itself (Subphase R-1, v2.19.0).

**Supported shells: bash and zsh.** fish is **not** supported — see the gap note below.

**Behavior:**
1. **Static completion** (commands and flags) comes from Click's generated script, which project-guide post-processes before installing
2. **Dynamic mode name completion**: `project-guide mode <TAB>` reads the active project's `.metadata.yml` and returns matching mode names; works with custom modes
3. Completion callbacks never crash the user's shell — any error returns an empty list silently
4. **Independent of `PATH`.** The resolved binary path is baked into the completion callback, so completion keeps working when project-guide is hosted behind a shim that is not on `PATH` (pyve's toolchain layout)
5. **Silent degradation is mandatory.** A broken, stale, or half-removed install prints nothing — not at shell startup, and not on TAB. Completion is a convenience; noise on every prompt would be a worse regression than the missing completion it replaces

**The `completion` command group:**

```
project-guide completion install   [--shell auto|zsh|bash] [--bin <path>] [--rc <path>] [--dir <path>] [-q]
project-guide completion uninstall [--shell auto|zsh|bash] [--rc <path>] [--dir <path>] [-q]
project-guide completion show      [--shell auto|zsh|bash] [--bin <path>]
project-guide completion status    [--shell all|zsh|bash] [--rc <path>] [--dir <path>]
```

- **`install`** — idempotent; a no-op when everything is already current. Replaces a legacy pyve-written block in place rather than adding a second one beside it.
- **`uninstall`** — byte-clean: the rc file is restored exactly as `install` found it.
- **`show`** — prints the post-processed script to stdout and writes nothing. Takes neither `--quiet` (its stdout *is* the payload) nor `--no-input` (it never prompts).
- **`status`** — reports per shell: `absent` / `installed` / `stale` / `partial` / `damaged`. Exit 0 when everything is absent or current, 1 when any shell needs attention, 2 on an I/O error.
- **`--bin`** — lets a host tool supply the stable handle. pyve passes its `~/.local/bin/project-guide` shim, not the version-keyed toolchain path behind it, which rots on every pyve Python bump. Resolution when absent: the path project-guide was invoked as, then a `PATH` lookup.

**Two routes, deliberately asymmetric.** zsh gets an `fpath` autoload file (the route its `#compdef` header is built for) plus a small rc block that wires it up; bash gets the script written inline into a sentinel-bracketed rc block, the only route available to it. See `tech-spec.md` § "Shell Completion Installation" for the mechanism.

**rc-file safety contract.** This is the only project-guide feature that writes outside the project directory:

- Only project-guide's own `# >>> project-guide completion >>>` block is rewritten. A block project-guide did not write is reported, never edited — the single exception being pyve's exact legacy block while it still carries pyve's generated content.
- The rc file is backed up (`.bak.<timestamp>`) before any content-changing write.
- Re-running with everything current writes nothing.
- `install` → `uninstall` round-trips the rc file byte-for-byte.

**Staleness means "would reinstalling change anything?" (Story R.r, v2.21.0).** An install is **stale** when either is true:

1. **The baked `--bin` no longer resolves** — the pyve-toolchain-bump case. Tested with `os.access(path, os.X_OK)`, the *same* predicate the installed script bakes in, so `status` and the shell cannot disagree about a file whose permission bit was lost.
2. **The installed script differs from what this version generates** — regenerated from parameters recovered out of the installed artifacts (`--bin` from the post-processed callback, the zsh autoload directory from the installed `fpath` line) and compared. Both zsh artifacts are checked, since the autoload file carries the callback and the rc block carries the bootstrap, and either can drift alone.

The version stamp in the block is **diagnostic, never decisional** — it names which release generated the block in the warning. Comparing it to `__version__` would fire on every release, including the large majority that never touch the completion template, turning a precise signal into noise. For the same reason the provenance lines are excluded from the compared text.

**When exactness is unreachable, warn less.** The warning fires from the pre-invoke hook ahead of every command, so a false positive is noise on every invocation. Three cases therefore report `installed` rather than guessing: a **bare-name install** (no baked `--bin`, so no parameter to regenerate from — reported with its `PATH` note), a block stamped **newer** than the running project-guide (two installs commonly coexist under pyve hosting; reinstalling would *downgrade* it), and any inspection error. Where both staleness causes hold at once, the dead path is reported — it is the more actionable diagnosis.

Inspection is read-only, silent, and cheap: script regeneration suppresses Click's bash-version notice (right at install time, wrong during inspection) and is cached per process, because the hook runs before every command.

**`heal` integration.** `heal` (and the pre-invoke auto-hook) warns on stderr when completion is installed but **stale** or **partial**, naming the specific reason — the dead path, or the drift plus the version that generated the block — and the copyable remedy. It **never** auto-repairs: writing to a user's startup files unasked is out of bounds, the same constraint that bounds the `git-push` wrapper. Silent when completion is absent or current, and under `--no-input` / CI.

**Known gaps, stated so the docs do not over-promise:**

- **fish is not supported.** Click can generate a fish script, but fish uses a third install mechanism (a file in `~/.config/fish/completions/`, no rc block), so project-guide cannot install what it would generate. `completion show --shell fish` is refused rather than emitting a script the group cannot manage. Deferred to a follow-on story.
- **macOS system bash 3.2** registers completion (the emitted `complete -o nosort … 2>/dev/null || complete …` fallback handles `-o nosort` being bash ≥ 4.4), but **dir/file** completions still fail there because Click's script calls `compopt`, a bash ≥ 4.0 builtin. Linux bash and Homebrew bash are unaffected.
- **PowerShell / Windows shells.** Click ships no generator for them, so this is a documented asymmetry against project-guide's general Windows support.
- **Windows is unverified even for bash and zsh.** The group targets POSIX shells, and its path handling is `os.path`-based: on Windows `--bin` resolves to a Windows-convention path (`D:\…`) which is then shell-quoted into a bash/zsh script, and a backslash path is not what a bash-family shell such as git-bash expects. Nothing refuses to run there and the test suite passes, but no generated script has been exercised under git-bash or MSYS. Treat bash/zsh completion as **macOS- and Linux-supported**; a Windows decision (support git-bash properly, or refuse with a clear message) is deferred to a follow-on story.

The change request that motivated this work is recorded in [`shell-completion-ownership.md`](shell-completion-ownership.md); the delivered design, including where it departs from that request, is in [`phase-r-subphase-1-shell-completion-plan.md`](phase-r-subphase-1-shell-completion-plan.md).

### FR-8: Non-Interactive / CI Mode

`--no-input`, `CI=1`, `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1`, and non-TTY stdin all suppress interactive prompts on `init`, `update`, `purge`, and `heal`. The first matching trigger wins (priority order: explicit flag → env var → CI env → non-TTY).

**Behavior:**
- `purge`: skips the "Are you sure?" confirmation prompt when any trigger fires. Combines with `--force` (the latter signals intent; the former signals environment).
- `update`: flag is present for future-prompt parity; `update` currently has no interactive prompts.
- `init`: flag is present; no prompts exist today but the plumbing is in place.
- `heal`: replaces the `[Y/n]` drift prompt with auto-yes; emits a one-line stderr notice (`Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.`) so CI logs and embedding callers have a visible signal. The auto-hook (FR-14) inherits the same contract via env / TTY signals.

### FR-9: Quiet Mode (machine / embedding)

`--quiet` / `-q` on `init`, `update`, and `purge` is intended for **embedded** and CI callers that compose with **`--no-input`** (e.g. pyve scaffolding refreshes).

**Behavior:**
- On **success**, these commands emit **nothing to stdout** (including dry-run summaries, progress banners, and green completion lines).
- **Errors** and **material warnings** are **never suppressed**: they print to **stderr** (e.g. schema/load failures, render warnings, skipped overridden files, `init --force` previous-config backup notice, purge “not found (skipped)” hints when paths were already removed).
- Exit codes are unchanged vs non-quiet invocation.

**Interaction with `--verbose`:** Only **`project-guide mode`** defines `--verbose` today; there is no combined `--quiet` + `--verbose` on the same command. If both flags ever apply to one command, **`--quiet` wins**.

### FR-10: Story Detection in Status

`project-guide status` parses `<spec_artifacts_path>/stories.md` and adds a **Stories** section showing total/done/in-progress/planned counts and the next unstarted story. Section is omitted when the file is absent or contains no story headings (e.g., post-archive). `--verbose` adds a per-phase breakdown.

### FR-11: Mode Listing with Availability Markers and Interactive Menu

`project-guide mode` (no argument) displays a grouped, annotated mode listing:

- Modes are grouped by category (Getting Started, Project Planning, Scaffold, Coding, Debugging, Documentation, Refactoring, Release Planning) with ordered category headers reflecting the project lifecycle flow.
- Each mode is annotated: `→` (current, cyan background highlight), `✓` (all prerequisites met, green), `✗` (unmet prerequisites, yellow, dimmed name).
- `--verbose` / `-v` shows the unmet prerequisite file paths beneath each `✗` entry.
- On a real TTY (unless `--no-input`, `CI=1`, or non-TTY stdin), a numbered selection menu is shown after the listing, allowing the developer to switch mode by entering a number. Empty input cancels. Up to 3 attempts before exit 1.

### FR-12: Per-Project Metadata Overrides

`metadata_overrides` in `.project-guide.yml` allows per-project patching of individual mode fields without editing the bundled `.metadata.yml`. Only these fields are patchable: `next_mode`, `files_exist`, `info`, `description`. Partial patch semantics — unmentioned fields are unchanged. Unknown mode names or fields raise `MetadataError`. Overrides are applied at every `load_metadata()` call site.

### FR-13: Pyve Detection and Auto-Rendered pyve-essentials.md

`project-guide init` resolves pyve's version from the first available of: `--pyve-version` → `PYVE_VERSION` env var → a `pyve --version` probe. A host tool that already knows the answer (pyve invokes `init` and knows its own version with certainty) supplies it and no subprocess runs; a blank value at either supplied level means *not supplied* and falls through. The resolved value is normalized to a bare `3.2.2` and stored as `pyve_version` in `.project-guide.yml`; on probe failure (`FileNotFoundError`, non-zero exit, timeout), `null` is stored. Detection failure is non-fatal, but **not silent** — `init` warns on stderr (surviving `--quiet` and `--no-input`) that the guidance will be omitted, and names the remedy.

**`pyve_installed` is a persisted field, not a derivation.** It answers "should the Pyve guidance render?"; `pyve_version` answers "which pyve was seen?". Deriving the first from the second is what turned a single failed probe into the permanent loss of ~80 lines of guardrail from every rendered `go.md`, so the two are decoupled and the flag is stored in its own right. A config predating the field defaults it to `pyve_version is not None`, so no project changes behavior at the moment of upgrade; a key that *is* present always wins.

**Sticky-true.** Automatic detection may set `pyve_installed` to `true` and never to `false`. A failed probe leaves both fields untouched: detection is unreliable in ways unrelated to whether pyve is really present (an un-rehashed `PATH`, a slow first run, a sandbox), and treating any of those as "pyve is gone" is what removed the guardrail. Once a project has seen pyve even once, no later miss can strip the guidance. Turning the flag off is an explicit user action — hand-editing `.project-guide.yml` — which holds only while detection keeps missing; a successful detection sets it back on. `init` is the sole exception to sticky-true: it may record a miss as `false`, having no prior observation to overwrite.

**Refresh sites.** `pyve_version` is a cache, so `update` and an explicit `mode <name>` switch re-probe and write back a changed result — converting a permanent detection failure into a transient one. A changed result also forces the `go.md` re-render, which would otherwise not fire for a project that is in sync. The bare `mode` listing does not probe, `--dry-run` does not probe, and **`_apply_heal` never probes**: it runs from the pre-invoke auto-hook ahead of every command including `--help` and `--version`, and a subprocess there is the Story Q.t hang class. A failed refresh is silent; the loud warning belongs to `init`, a once-per-project event.

The `pyve_installed` boolean is passed as a Jinja2 context variable at every render call site. When true, `render.py` reads `templates/artifacts/pyve-essentials.md` from the template tree and passes its content as the `pyve_essentials` context variable. `_header-common.md` renders it as a `### Pyve Essentials` subsection nested inside the `## Project Essentials` wrapper, so every `go.md` across every mode surfaces the bundled pyve rules automatically.

This is a package-versioned auto-render rather than a one-shot merge: improvements to `pyve-essentials.md` flow to every project on the next `project-guide mode <name>` invocation without any scaffold-time copy step.

The bundled `templates/artifacts/pyve-essentials.md` artifact covers: two-environment pattern, canonical invocation forms, LLM-internal vs. developer-facing invocation rule, `python` vs `python3` asdf-shim rule, `requirements-dev.txt` story-writing convention, and editable install / testenv dependency management.

### FR-14: Auto-Heal & Self-Repair Install

`project-guide heal` repairs the install in place: detects drift between the bundled package templates and the on-disk template tree under `target_dir`, then creates missing files and refreshes stale (hash-divergent) ones. Unlike `update`, `heal` also creates missing files — so it is the right command after a fresh clone in a repo that gitignores everything under `target_dir` except `go.md`.

**Division of labor — `init` vs. `update` vs. `heal`.** These three commands are deliberately distinct; confusing them leads to recommending the wrong one:

| Command | Creates missing files | Refreshes drifted files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `init` | ✅ (all of them) | n/a | One-time bootstrap: writes `.project-guide.yml`, copies the template tree, renders the initial `go.md`. Refuses a second run without `--force`. |
| `update` | ❌ | ✅ | Refreshes only files **that exist on disk**. Absent files are `heal`'s job. |
| `heal` | ✅ | ✅ | `update` plus create-missing, with silent-when-clean behavior and the auto-hook. The right command for a fresh clone whose template tree is gitignored. |

**Inputs:** `--no-input` (auto-yes the prompt; emit stderr notice — see FR-8).

**Behavior:**
- **Silent when clean.** Zero drift → exit 0 with no stdout. This silence is required so the auto-hook below can fire on every invocation without polluting steady-state output.
- **Prompts when drift is detected.** Interactive: print one-line stderr summary (`N templates missing or stale.`), then `Update? [Y/n]` (default Y on bare Enter). Decline → exit 1 without writing.
- **Auto-yes under skip-input mode** (FR-8): replace the prompt with the stderr notice `Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.` then apply.
- **Hard error on missing config.** Missing `.project-guide.yml` → exit 1 with `Missing .project-guide.yml — run 'project-guide init' to bootstrap the project.` `heal` does not bootstrap.
- **Schema mismatch handling** mirrors `update`: older-schema → point at `init --force`; newer-schema → instruct to upgrade the package.

**Auto-hook (recursion-guarded):** every `project-guide` invocation, **including `--help` and `--version`**, runs the heal drift-detection + prompt path *before* dispatching the subcommand. The hook is implemented as a custom Click `Group` subclass that overrides `main()` so eager flags (`--help`, `--version`) do not short-circuit before the hook runs. The hook is silent in the steady state and prompts only on actual drift; declining the prompt does not block the original subcommand. Recursion across nested `project-guide` subprocess invocations is prevented by setting `PROJECT_GUIDE_HEALING=1` in `os.environ` whenever `heal` runs (whether via the hook or invoked directly).

**Skip conditions for the hook:**
- `PROJECT_GUIDE_HEALING=1` is set (recursion guard).
- `.project-guide.yml` is absent (let `init` bootstrap; the hook does not error).
- The config fails to load (schema mismatch, parse error) — the subcommand surfaces the error with its own guidance.

**Inverted gitignore policy.** `init`'s gitignore writer produces a canonical block under a `# project-guide` header that ignores everything under `target_dir` *except* `go.md`. The block has gone through three shapes; the **tracking status** of `go.md` flipped in v2.8.0 (P.d → P.j → P.l → P.o):

- **v2.6.0 (P.d):** 4-line negation form (`<target>/**` + `!<target>/go.md` + redundant `<target>/**/*.bak.*`).
- **v2.6.1 (P.j):** 3-line negation form — dropped the redundant `.bak.*` line.
- **v2.7.1 (P.l):** **negation-free explicit-list form** — lists every top-level entry under `target_dir` other than `go.md`, plus a `<target>/**/*.bak.*` catch-all for top-level backups. The list is generated dynamically from the bundled template tree, so new top-level files/subdirectories added in future releases are picked up automatically.
- **v2.8.0 (P.o):** **untracked-by-default `go.md`**. The gitignore block is unchanged from v2.7.1 — `go.md` is still un-listed (and therefore unignored), preserving IDE-LLM visibility. What flips is the **tracking status**: `go.md` is no longer in the consumer's git index. `heal` warns (stderr) when it detects a tracked `go.md` with a copyable `git rm --cached docs/project-guide/go.md && git commit` migration command; `init` emits a stderr note that fresh installs leave `go.md` untracked. Branch switches and merges no longer trip on `go.md`.

P.l abandoned the negation form because several IDE-integrated tools (Cursor, parts of the VS Code fork ecosystem, certain LSP-based search backends) implement a subset of `.gitignore` semantics that does not honor re-include negation — they apply the broad `**` rule, hide `go.md` from @-mention / fuzzy-search, and defeat the IDE-LLM-visibility constraint that's the whole reason `go.md` stays unignored. The v2.8.0 tracking flip preserves that visibility — `go.md` remains unignored — while removing the version-control churn and branch-switch failure mode that motivated P.o.

Consumers migrating from a pre-Phase-P install run `project-guide init --force` to refresh the gitignore block. Consumers upgrading from v2.6.x/v2.7.x to v2.8.0 run `git rm --cached docs/project-guide/go.md && git commit` once on their default branch to migrate the tracking status; `heal` surfaces the warning until the migration is applied. Existing pre-v2.7.1 installs heal to the v2.7.1 explicit-list form on the next `init --force` — every prior shape stays recognized by `_is_recognized_block_line()`.

### FR-15: Story-Aware `git-push` / `git-commit` Wrappers (gitbetter integration)

`project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]` wraps [gitbetter](https://github.com/pointmatic/gitbetter)'s `git-push` with story metadata: it derives the commit message from the most-recently-completed-and-not-yet-committed story in `docs/specs/stories.md` and shells out to gitbetter to perform the actual push. The wrapper collapses the developer's per-story commit step from "find the story ID, format the message, type the command" to a single command, while delegating every real git operation (preview, confirm, branch cleanup, reject/recovery menu) to gitbetter.

**`git-commit` sibling (Story R.a, v2.18.1).** `project-guide git-commit [BRANCH_NAME]` performs a **local commit** instead of a push, so the developer can iterate on commits locally and push a batch to GitHub later (saving CI minutes). Its interface and behavior are **identical** — everything in this requirement applies to both wrappers unchanged, differing only in which gitbetter binary is invoked. Read every "the wrapper" below as "either wrapper."

**Heading-to-message transformation:**
- Input: `### Story G.a: v1.2.3 New command \`foo\` with "Hello" [Done]`
- Output: `G.a: v1.2.3 New command 'foo' with 'Hello'`
- Rules: strip `### Story ` prefix and ` [Done]` suffix; replace backticks and double quotes with single quotes; preserve single quotes and the colon after the story ID. The colon is the anchor the already-committed check searches for in `git log --pretty=%s`.

**Candidate selection.** Before any branch decision, the `[Done]` story list is filtered: a `[Done]` story whose body contains **zero** checklist items of any kind (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`) is a **header** — a group-overview heading for a sub-numbered cluster like `H.m` / `H.m.1` / `H.m.2` — and has no work to commit, so it is excluded from uncommitted-detection. The rule is deliberately forgiving: a `[Done]` story with all-*unchecked* items is still a real story (unchecked items are a developer-discipline concern, not a header signal). This filter is scoped to the wrappers; `status` still counts headers in its totals.

**What counts as committed (Story R.v, v2.21.1).** A story is committed if **either** its ID appears in a commit subject **or** it is already marked `[Done]` in `stories.md` as committed at `HEAD`. The second source exists because the first is destroyed by squash merges: merging rewrites the subjects of the commits it absorbs into a PR title, but it carries the `stories.md` those commits edited — so the file at `HEAD` still records what shipped. Both readers contribute nothing (rather than erroring) when git is unavailable, the cwd is not a repository, the repo has no commits, or `stories.md` is untracked.

This assumes a story's `[Done]` flip lands in the same commit as its work, which the wrappers enforce by staging the whole tree. A `[Done]` flip committed ahead of the work it describes reads as shipped.

**Sequence discipline.** After the header filter, the remaining `[Done]` stories in document order must form a clean **committed-prefix → uncommitted-suffix** partition. An uncommitted story positioned before the last committed story is **out-of-sequence**. Phase boundaries are not respected — the partition is over the flat document-order list.

The discipline is suspended where it would produce false positives: squash merges to main rewrite commit subjects (PR titles), so earlier `[Done]` stories may not parse from the log at hand even though they shipped. In that case, if at least one `[Done]` story parses (an **anchor**), every `[Done]` story before it is presumed merged and announced as such; the normal flow then runs on the remaining tail.

The anchor presumption reaches **backwards only** — it says nothing about stories positioned *after* the anchor. Squash merges land at the tip of history, so those are exactly the stories most likely to have shipped opaquely; before R.v this produced a bundle offer spanning work that had already merged. The `[Done]`-at-`HEAD` source covers that direction, and the anchor now serves the histories it cannot reach (a `stories.md` renamed, moved, or untracked at `HEAD`).

**The gate reads the destination, not the checkout (Story R.p, v2.21.0).** Suspension is selected by *where the work is going* — a supplied `BRANCH_NAME` — rather than which branch happens to be checked out. Kicking off a branch from a squash-merged `main` is the case this exists for: the strict discipline would otherwise be measured against a log that cannot contain those stories, and would either hard-error or propose a commit subject spanning the whole file. Three boundaries:

- **Naming the current branch is not branch work.** `git-push main` while on `main` keeps the strict discipline; the argument is not an opt-out from out-of-sequence detection. Naming the branch you are already on *while off* `main` (`git-push feature/x` on `feature/x`) stays suspended, as it was before.
- **No argument on `main`/`master` keeps the strict discipline**, unchanged. The relaxation is reachable only by explicitly naming a destination.
- **An undeterminable branch stays strict** (git absent, not a repo, no commits). The mechanism needs a branch to scan and a name to quote.

Presumption announcements name the branch whose log was **scanned** — the current one. The destination has no log yet, and may not exist.

**Behavior — the full decision table.** "strict" is the full sequence discipline: on `main`/`master` with no `BRANCH_NAME`, and whenever the branch is undeterminable. "suspended" is the presumption path: any other branch, or any checkout where a `BRANCH_NAME` naming a *different* branch was supplied.

| Situation | Branch | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `stories.md` absent | any | exit 1 |
| No `[Done]` story at all | any | exit 1 — `No completed story found in <path>.` (a `stories.md` authoring problem) |
| Nothing commit-worthy (all committed, or only headers remain) | any | **exit 0** — `Nothing to commit — every real [Done] story is already in git log.`, naming any `[Done]` headers present |
| Exactly 1 uncommitted, in sequence | any | derive single-story message → invoke the gitbetter tool |
| 2+ uncommitted, in sequence | any | propose a bundled subject, prompt `[Y/n]` (default `Y`). Decline → exit 1 with the manual-resolution hint |
| Out-of-sequence, exactly 1 uncommitted | strict | prompt `Commit this single out-of-sequence story? [y/N]` (default **`N`**). Accept → single-story commit. Decline → offender error block, exit 1 |
| Out-of-sequence, 2+ uncommitted | strict | exit 1 with the offender block (each offender + its later-committed context + the eligible tail). **No prompt** — attribution across several stories is genuinely ambiguous |
| Anchor found | suspended | announce the anchor and the presumed-merged stories; run the normal flow on the uncommitted tail |
| No anchor, 2+ uncommitted | suspended | offer `Commit just the last one? [Y/n]` (default **`Y`**). Decline → fall through to the bundle offer |
| Same `<id>` in 2+ commit subjects | any | stderr warning listing the offending subjects, prompt `Continue? [Y/n]` (default `Y`) |
| gitbetter tool not on PATH | any | exit 1 naming the missing tool + install hint (`brew install pointmatic/tap/gitbetter`) |

**Prompt defaults encode risk.** The bundle offer defaults `Y` (bundling is routine); the out-of-sequence offer defaults `N` (committing out of sequence is the surprising state); the no-anchor offer defaults `Y` (low risk — worst case the developer amends the message, and the branch then has an anchor).

**`--no-input` never auto-yeses a judgment call.** Bundling auto-declines (it changes the commit's shape — a developer decision, not a CI default). Out-of-sequence auto-declines to the error block, so CI never silently commits out of sequence. The duplicate-`<id>` warning auto-**aborts** with exit 1 so CI surfaces the history anomaly rather than papering over it.

**gitbetter flag pass-through (Story R.q, v2.21.0).** Two gitbetter flags are reachable through both wrappers:

- **`--keep` / `-k`** — passed straight through (it skips gitbetter's post-push branch-cleanup prompt). No project-guide semantics attach to it. It composes with `BRANCH_NAME` and with `--amend`.
- **`--amend`** — commit the current tree onto the last commit, **reusing that commit's subject verbatim**. This short-circuits the derivation flow entirely rather than adding a branch to it: no message is being decided, so candidate selection, the bundle offer, and the sequence discipline do not apply. Notably it must *bypass* the `Nothing to commit` exit-0 path, since already-committed is `--amend`'s precondition rather than its blocker. A missing or storyless `stories.md` is tolerated here, unlike the normal flow.

The subject is **preserved, never re-derived** from `stories.md`. Re-deriving would rewrite a commit's message as a side effect of amending a fix into it — a developer who assigns a version to a story title after committing would get a rename they never asked for — and would silently canonicalize a legacy bundled subject, since the parser is permissive on read while emission is strict.

`--amend` carries two refusals, both hard:

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--no-input` / `CI=1` / non-TTY stdin | exit 1. `--amend` force-pushes with `--force-with-lease`; a history-shape decision is not a CI default — the same reasoning that keeps the out-of-sequence path from auto-yesing |
| A `[Done]` story is uncommitted | exit 1, naming the offender. gitbetter runs `git add -A` before amending, so that story's work would land inside the previous commit under the previous commit's message — straight through the one-unit-of-work-one-commit invariant the wrapper exists to serve |
| No previous commit exists | exit 1 — `No previous commit to amend.`, checked before the staging guard so a fresh repo gets the precise diagnosis rather than "commit that story first" |

The staging guard is scoped to `[Done]`-but-uncommitted stories, and reads the same presumed committed-set as the flow (so it does not refuse on every squash-merged feature branch). In-progress work on a `[Planned]` story is invisible to it and will still be staged: amending commits your tree, which is git's documented contract, and the wrapper does not become a general-purpose working-tree guard.

**The wrapper-value principle.** What bounds every current and future wrapper feature:

> The wrapper earns its place by **integration** — reading `stories.md` and `git log` so the developer copies and pastes less. A feature that reads neither belongs in the bare `gitbetter` command, not here.

This is why `--keep` carries no semantics, why `--amend` has no `-m` / `--message` override (an explicitly supplied message is exactly where the wrapper contributes nothing over `git-commit --amend "msg"`), and why the staging guard is in scope while a general working-tree guard is not.

**Passthrough guarantee.** The wrapper is a thin convenience layer, not a parallel implementation. gitbetter stays **fully interactive** — its prompts, previews, and reject/recovery menu reach the developer unaltered — and its exit code is propagated **unchanged**, so the external tool's semantics are the source of truth rather than the wrapper's. The wrapper adds message derivation and candidate selection; it never reinterprets a git outcome.

**LLM-vs-developer-lane.** This is a developer-lane convenience command. The LLM **does not** initiate it — the approval-gate discipline (do not propose commits, pushes, or follow-ups at story-end) remains in force. The wrapper is invoked by the developer after the LLM presents a completed story.

**`spec_artifacts_path` resolution.** The wrapper reads `spec_artifacts_path` from project-guide metadata when available; otherwise falls back to `docs/specs`. This lets the wrapper work in projects that haven't yet run `project-guide init`, including this project itself before metadata renders.

**Implementation.** The bundled-subject emit grammar, the commit-subject parser's permissive-read / strict-emit asymmetry, and the partition and anchor algorithms are implementation concerns — see `tech-spec.md` § "External CLI Dependencies."

## Cross-Repo Contracts

project-guide is designed to be hosted by **Pyve** as a globally-shimmed tool in Pyve's toolchain venv (a single install on `PATH` via `~/.local/bin/project-guide`, rather than a per-project `pip install`). That hosting model depends on four behavioral contracts that Pyve pins against. Three already hold and are guarded by tests; the fourth is the pyve-managed-hosting awareness behavior. Any change to a contract surface is a **coordinated breaking change** requiring a paired Pyve story.

| # | Contract | Guarantee | Guarding test |
|---|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Install-location independence** | `init`, `update`, and `mode` read templates from the package install location but write per-project state only to the current working directory; nothing writes back into the shared install. | `tests/test_cross_repo_contract.py::test_per_project_state_written_to_cwd_not_package_location` |
| 2 | **`--version` output format** | `project-guide --version` emits exactly `project-guide, version X.Y.Z` (standard Click format). The shape — not the version number — is the contract Pyve parses. | `tests/test_cross_repo_contract.py::test_version_output_format_is_cross_repo_contract` |
| 3 | **`.project-guide.yml` marker shape** | The project-root marker is named exactly `.project-guide.yml` and always carries at least `version`, `installed_version`, `target_dir`, and `current_mode`. Additional fields may exist; their absence is not a violation. | `tests/test_cross_repo_contract.py::test_project_guide_yml_marker_shape` |
| 4 | **Pyve-managed-hosting awareness (readiness-gated)** | When pyve is detected, templates and CLI output reflect the pyve-managed-hosting context. The local-install warning is **readiness-gated and non-destructive** (Subphase Q-4): it detects pyve *live* (`shutil.which("pyve")`, not the cached `pyve_version`), then consults the read-only `pyve self provision --status --json` query and classifies its exit code — **0** (global ready) → benign-duplicate notice advising `pip uninstall`; **2** (not pyve-managed here) → silent; **1 / 127 / OSError / other**, or a **timed-out/hung probe** (`subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, caught alongside `OSError`, bounded at `timeout=5` per Q.t) → readiness-first guidance that **never** advises removal. The core invariant is **never advise `pip uninstall project-guide` unless the query returns exit 0**. The behavior **degrades safely** when the query is absent/old (treated as non-zero → readiness-first). `heal` additionally offers, interactively, to delegate provisioning to `pyve self provision`. | Implementation only (FR — see Subphase Q-3 / Q.m, refined Subphase Q-4 / Q.q); behavior, not a pinned-format contract. |

Changing the `.project-guide.yml` filename, removing any of the contract fields, or altering the `--version` format requires a coordinated change with Pyve. The readiness-gated warning (#4) carries a **two-way version coordination**: project-guide's gating expects **pyve ≥ the release that ships `pyve self provision --status`** (degrading to readiness-first below that), and pyve adopting this messaging pins **project-guide ≥ v2.15.0** (mirroring the existing `≥ 2.13.0` hosting pin). See `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` → "Pyve cross-repo contracts" for the architectural invariants and [`.archive/phase-q-pyve-toolchain-hosting.md`](.archive/phase-q-pyve-toolchain-hosting.md) for the cross-repo contract source.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Metadata loading, variable resolution, mode lookup
- Jinja2 rendering with mode templates and header partials
- Config save/load round-trip, override management
- File sync: hash comparison, copy, backup
- Template path resolution and file discovery

### Integration Tests
- Full init → override → update workflow
- Hash-based status (version mismatch with matching content shows "current")
- Force update with backups
- Multi-project isolation
- Dry-run mode

### Parametrized Tests
- Every mode in `.metadata.yml` must render without errors (regression guard for new modes)

**Minimum Coverage**: 85% code coverage (currently ~91%)

---

## Security and Compliance Notes

1. **File Safety**: Never overwrite files without explicit consent (`--force` or user approval)
2. **Backup Creation**: `.bak` backups with timestamps created before any forced overwrite
3. **No Secrets**: Package contains only documentation templates, no sensitive data
4. **No Network**: Operates entirely offline after installation

---

## Performance Expectations

1. **File I/O**: All operations are file-based; performance is not a concern
2. **Hash Comparison**: SHA-256 hash of small files (<100KB each) is effectively instant
3. **Rendering**: Jinja2 template rendering completes in milliseconds

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `project-guide init` creates the full template tree and renders `go.md` in `default` mode; detects pyve and stores `pyve_version`
2. `project-guide mode <name>` switches mode and re-renders `go.md`
3. `project-guide mode` (no argument) shows grouped listing with ✓/✗/→ markers; interactive menu on TTY
4. `project-guide status` shows compact grouped output with hash-based file state and Stories section
5. `project-guide update` syncs files using content-hash comparison, not version numbers
6. `project-guide override/unoverride` manages file locks correctly
7. `project-guide purge` cleanly removes all project-guide files; respects `--no-input` / `CI=1`
8. `--no-input` and `--quiet` on `init`, `update`, `purge`, and `heal`: prompts suppressed via FR-8; FR-9 guarantees **silent stdout on success** and diagnostics on stderr; under skip-input `heal` emits the `Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.` stderr notice when writes occur
9. `metadata_overrides` in `.project-guide.yml` patches mode fields without editing bundled metadata
10. All 17 modes render without errors (parametrized test)
11. Shell completion (Tab) works for commands, flags, and mode names in bash/zsh/fish after one-line setup
12. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
13. Test coverage is ≥85%
14. Package is published to PyPI as `project-guide`
15. `project-guide heal` (FR-14) is **silent on no drift** and applies fixes after the `[Y/n]` prompt on drift; under `--no-input` / `CI=1` / non-TTY the prompt is replaced with auto-yes plus the `Auto-healing N templates under --no-input.` stderr notice
16. The auto-hook fires for every CLI invocation including `--help` and `--version`, is silent in the steady state, recursion-guarded by `PROJECT_GUIDE_HEALING=1`, and never blocks the original subcommand on prompt decline
17. `project-guide git-push [BRANCH_NAME]` (FR-15) derives the commit message from the last `[Done]` story, hard-errors on already-committed or multi-uncommitted-Done states or missing gitbetter, and propagates gitbetter's child exit code unchanged; `project-guide git-commit [BRANCH_NAME]` behaves identically against gitbetter's `git-commit` binary
