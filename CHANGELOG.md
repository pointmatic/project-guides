# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.14] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — Added `push: tags: ['v*']` trigger so the build-and-publish job runs automatically on any version tag push, in addition to the existing GitHub Release publication trigger.

## [2.4.13] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **`templates/modes/_header-common.md`** — Added universal rule to every mode's Rules block: when creating a new source file, add a copyright notice and license header using the comment syntax for that file type, referencing the project's `project-essentials.md` for specific values.
- **`templates/artifacts/project-essentials.md`** — Added `### File header conventions` starter section with language/syntax reference table, placeholder copyright/SPDX fields, and examples for Python, TypeScript, and HTML.
- **`templates/artifacts/project-essentials-pyve.md`** — Added `### Editable install and testenv dependency management` section covering the `pythonpath` vs testenv editable install decision, when each applies, and pyve purge survival.
- **`developer/python-editable-install.md`** — New developer reference guide covering editable installs for both general Python projects and pyve two-environment setups: `pythonpath` vs editable install decision guide, pyve-specific installation patterns, purge survival, and a common-mistakes table.

## [2.4.12] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **`docs/specs/features.md`** — Added `archive_stories` to FR-1 modes table; added Stories section to FR-5 status; added FR-8 through FR-13 covering `--no-input`, `--quiet`, story detection in status, mode listing with availability markers and interactive menu, per-project metadata overrides, and pyve detection; updated `.project-guide.yml` schema block with `test_first`, `pyve_version`, `metadata_overrides`; updated CLI inputs and acceptance criteria.
- **`docs/specs/tech-spec.md`** — Updated `Config` dataclass fields (added `test_first`, `pyve_version`, `metadata_overrides`); updated `metadata.py` module description to include `_apply_metadata_overrides`; updated `render.py` signature; updated filename conventions example.
- **`README.md`** — Updated mode listing output example; updated `mode` command options (`--verbose`, `--no-input`); updated `status` output description with Stories section; updated `update` and `purge` options (`--no-input`, `--quiet`); updated config schema with new fields.
- **`docs/site/user-guide/modes.md`** — Updated "Listing Modes" section with marker legend and interactive menu description.
- **`docs/site/user-guide/commands.md`** — Updated `mode`, `status`, `update`, and `purge` sections with new options and behavior.

## [2.4.11] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Memory reflection rule in every mode** — rule #7 added to the `_header-common.md` Rules block: before recording a new memory, the LLM must reflect whether the fact is project-specific (belongs in `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`), cross-project (belongs in LLM memory), or both. Propagates to all 15 modes via the shared header template.

## [2.4.10] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Memory Review step in `scaffold_project` mode** — penultimate step (before "Present for Approval") instructs the LLM to read its recorded project memories, evaluate which are project-specific, present candidates to the developer, and append confirmed items to `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`. Includes an escape hatch for empty or inaccessible memory stores. Step numbering is conditional on `pyve_installed` (9 without pyve, 10 with).

### Changed
- **Current mode name highlighted in `project-guide mode` listing** — the selected mode name is now rendered with a cyan background and black text (`fg='black', bg='cyan'`) so it stands out clearly from available (✓) and unavailable (✗) entries.

## [2.4.9] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Pyve detection in `init`** — runs `pyve --version` at init time; stores `pyve_version` (string or `null`) in `.project-guide.yml`. `pyve_installed` is derived from the stored value at every render call site (`init`, `set_mode`, `update`).
- **Bundled `project-essentials-pyve.md` artifact** — template at `templates/artifacts/project-essentials-pyve.md` covering the two-environment pattern, canonical invocation forms (`pyve run`, `pyve test`, `pyve testenv run`), the `python` vs `python3` asdf-shim rule, and the `requirements-dev.txt` story-writing convention.
- **`{% if pyve_installed %}` branch in `scaffold-project-mode.md`** — adds a "Merge Pyve Project Essentials" step (numbered 8) that copies pyve-specific rules into `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`; "Present for Approval" renumbers to 9 accordingly.
- **`{% if pyve_installed %}` branch in `plan-tech-spec-mode.md`** — step 6 now tells Pyve users to also read and merge `project-essentials-pyve.md` when creating `project-essentials.md`.

## [2.4.8] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **`metadata_overrides` in `.project-guide.yml`** — projects can patch specific mode fields (`next_mode`, `files_exist`, `info`, `description`) without editing the bundled `.metadata.yml`. Partial patch semantics: unmentioned fields are unchanged. Unknown mode names or fields raise `MetadataError`. Overrides are applied at every `load_metadata()` call site (mode switch, status, archive-stories, update re-render).

## [2.4.7] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`project-guide mode` (no argument) now shows a prerequisite-annotated listing** — each mode is marked `→` (current), `✓` (all prerequisites met), or `✗` (unmet prerequisites, dimmed). Modes are grouped by category: Getting Started, Planning, Coding, Post-Release, Scaffold, Documentation, Debugging, Refactoring.
- **Interactive numbered menu on TTY** — on a real terminal, `project-guide mode` prompts for a selection number. Valid input switches mode + re-renders `go.md`; empty input cancels. Up to 3 attempts before exit 1. Under `--no-input`, `CI=1`, or non-TTY stdin, only the annotated listing is shown (exit 0).
- **`--verbose / -v` on `mode`** — shows unmet prerequisite file paths beneath each `✗` entry.
- **`--no-input` on `mode`** — skips the interactive menu and exits after printing the listing.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Stories section in `project-guide status`** — shows total/done/in-progress/planned counts and the next unstarted story, parsed from `<spec_artifacts_path>/stories.md` via `project_guide/stories.py`. Section is omitted when the file is absent or contains no story headings (e.g. post-archive). `--verbose` adds a per-phase breakdown.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`--quiet` / `-q` flag on `init`, `update`, and `purge`** — suppresses per-file progress lines. Errors, summaries (final counts), and explicit warnings (overridden-file notices) are always shown regardless of `--quiet`. Composes cleanly with `--no-input` for fully silent unattended runs.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`--no-input` flag on `purge`** — skips the confirmation prompt when set, when `CI=1`, or when stdin is non-TTY. Pairs with `--force`; both suppress the prompt but via different mechanisms (`--force` is "yes, I'm sure"; `--no-input` is "non-interactive environment").
- **`--no-input` flag on `update`** — infrastructure parity with `init`. `update` has no interactive prompts today; the plumbing is in place for future additions.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`--test-first` flag on `init`** — persists `test_first: bool` to `.project-guide.yml`. Resolved via `_resolve_setting` (CLI flag → `PROJECT_GUIDE_TEST_FIRST` env var → default `false`).
- **`test_first` Jinja2 context variable** — passed to all `render_go_project_guide` calls from `cli.py`. Planning modes that suggest a next coding step now use `{% if test_first %}code_test_first{% else %}code_direct{% endif %}`: `default-mode.md`, `plan-stories-mode.md`, `plan-phase-mode.md`.
- **`Config.test_first: bool`** — new field with load/save round-trip.

### Fixed
- **`plan-concept-mode.md` missing output step** — added step 4 "Write the completed document to `docs/specs/concept.md`." LLMs were asking where to write the output because no step named the destination file.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`_resolve_setting` helper in `runtime.py`** — reusable four-level resolution chain (CLI flag → env var → config key → default). Type is inferred from `default`: bool settings use `_TRUTHY_ENV_VALUES` for env-var matching; str settings are returned as-is. Required foundation for `--test-first` (N.d) and any future settable prompt.
- **Tests in `tests/test_runtime.py`** — priority-order parametrized tests, full fallback chain, bool/str env resolution, and a contract test pinning the function signature.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **`project-scaffold-mode.md` → `scaffold-project-mode.md`** — Renamed mode template file; mode key updated from `project_scaffold` to `scaffold_project` in `.metadata.yml`. `scaffold_project` follows the `<verb>_<noun>` convention established by every other mode.
- **Cross-references updated** — `default-mode.md`, `plan-stories-mode.md`, `docs/specs/features.md`, `docs/site/user-guide/modes.md`, `docs/site/user-guide/workflow.md`, `README.md`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **`code-velocity-mode.md` → `code-direct-mode.md`** — Renamed mode template file; mode key updated from `code_velocity` to `code_direct` in `.metadata.yml`. `code_direct` more clearly describes the mode (direct coding, no mandatory TDD) and pairs naturally with `code_test_first` under the `code_<style>` naming convention.
- **Cross-references updated** — `default-mode.md`, `code-test-first-mode.md`, `plan-stories-mode.md`, `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`, `docs/specs/features.md`, `docs/site/user-guide/modes.md`, `README.md`.
- **Tests updated** — `tests/test_render.py` and `tests/test_cli.py` renamed/updated all `code_velocity` references to `code_direct`.

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **`plan-stories-mode.md`** — Story A.a redefined from "Hello World" to "Project Scaffolding" (executed in `project_scaffold` mode); A.b is now Hello World; A.c is the stack spike. Added rule requiring every versioned story to include `Bump version to vX.Y.Z` and `Update CHANGELOG.md` as closing tasks. Updated Story Format example block and Phase A table to match.
- **`project-scaffold-mode.md`** — Added Step 7 to mark Story A.a `[Done]` in `stories.md` after scaffolding is complete (warns and continues if A.a is not found).

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Sequence-mode "Next Action" directive caused LLMs to skip steps** (Story M.i) — the `_header-sequence.md` include rendered a prominent "Next Action: Prompt the user to change modes" directive *before* the actual Steps section in all 9 sequence-mode templates. LLMs interpreted this as the primary instruction and jumped straight to suggesting a mode switch, ignoring the mode's steps entirely. Fix is belt-and-suspenders: (1) reworded `_header-sequence.md` from "Next Action / Prompt the user to change modes" to "After completing all steps below, prompt the user to change modes" so the directive is unambiguously post-completion, and (2) moved the `{% include "modes/_header-sequence.md" %}` from the top to the bottom of all 9 sequence-mode templates so the directive structurally appears after the steps.

### Changed
- **`_header-sequence.md`** — reworded from "Next Action / Prompt the user to change modes" to "After completing all steps below, prompt the user to change modes."
- **All 9 sequence-mode templates** — moved `{% include "modes/_header-sequence.md" %}` from top (before Prerequisites/Steps) to bottom (after all steps and reference material): `plan-concept-mode.md`, `plan-features-mode.md`, `plan-tech-spec-mode.md`, `plan-stories-mode.md`, `plan-phase-mode.md`, `archive-stories-mode.md`, `project-scaffold-mode.md`, `document-brand-mode.md`, `document-landing-mode.md`.

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **Minor tweaks to `plan-features-mode.md`** (Story M.h) — updated the planning mode template to be more aware of `concept.md` during feature planning. Updated pip-installed project-guide package to 2.3.6.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Approval-gate rule added universally** (Story M.g) — closes a dogfooding-discovered bug in the Phase M implementation where the assistant repeatedly proposed "commit first or continue?" footers at the end of story-approval summaries despite the system prompt's explicit `NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks`. Root cause: the `code_velocity` mode template's **Velocity Practices** section mixed LLM-lane instructions ("tests run after every story", "fix linting immediately") with developer-lane conventions ("direct commits to main", "commit messages reference story IDs") in a single unlabeled bullet list. A reasonable LLM reading the mixed list concluded it should offer to do the commit, since the convention was "direct commits with story-ID messages". The fix restructures the templates to separate the two lanes and adds a universal approval-gate rule to `_header-common.md` that inherits into every mode.
- **`_header-common.md` **Rules** block** — added a new rule after "Never auto-advance past an approval gate":
  > At approval gates, present the completed work and wait. Do **not** propose follow-up actions outside the current mode step — in particular, do not prompt for git operations (commits, pushes, PRs, branch creation), CI runs, or deploys unless the current step explicitly calls for them. The developer initiates these on their own schedule.
  This is the universal fix. Because `_header-common.md` is included once by `llm_entry_point.md`, every rendered `go.md` now carries the rule — the 14 modes (`default`, `plan_*`, `refactor_*`, `archive_stories`, `project_scaffold`, `code_*`, `debug`, `document_*`) all inherit it without needing per-mode edits.
- **`code-velocity-mode.md` "Velocity Practices" restructured into two explicitly-labeled lanes** — was a single unlabeled bullet list, is now `**LLM's role in each cycle:**` (version bump, minimal process overhead, tests after every story, fix linting immediately, update CHANGELOG before presenting) and `**Developer's role (do NOT prompt for, offer, or initiate):**` (direct commits to main, commit messages reference story IDs, decides when to commit). The "do NOT prompt for, offer, or initiate" language in the developer-lane header is load-bearing — it tells future template authors *why* the lane exists, which is the discipline that prevents this class of bug from recurring. The developer-lane header's "Decides when to commit" bullet explicitly notes that multiple stories may be bundled into one commit at the developer's discretion, which is not the LLM's call to make or suggest.
- **`code-velocity-mode.md` step 9 ("Present") tightened** — was `**Present** the completed story to the developer for approval`, is now `**Present** the completed story concisely: what changed (files + line refs), verification results (test counts, lint status), and the suggested next story. Do not propose commits, pushes, or bundling options. Do not offer "want me to also…?" follow-ups.` This is belt-and-suspenders reinforcement of the universal rule — it catches LLMs that skim the header and jump to the cycle steps.
- **`code-test-first-mode.md` step 8 ("Present") tightened** with the same language. `code_test_first` does NOT get the Velocity Practices lane restructure because it has no analogous section — the TDD cycle steps go straight from "Wait" to "Red-Green-Refactor" theory to "Test Writing Guidelines", with no mixed-lane bullet list to untangle. The universal `_header-common.md` rule is still sufficient for that mode.
- **`docs/specs/project-essentials.md` for this project** dogfooded with a new `### Approval gate discipline` subsection that summarizes the rule and explains the root cause (the mixed lanes in `code_velocity`'s Velocity Practices). This is deliberately circular: the fix ships by itself as an instruction in `_header-common.md`, AND this project's project-essentials captures the same rule, which the M.a render hook then injects as a second reinforcement when any mode is rendered against this repo.

### Tests
- **Parametrized `test_header_common_approval_gate_rule_renders_in_every_mode`** — the critical test. Runs across every mode returned by `_get_all_mode_names()` (currently 14 modes). For each, runs `init + mode <name>` in a fresh `CliRunner.isolated_filesystem()` and asserts the rendered `go.md` contains the pinned substring `"do not prompt for git operations"` *inside* the **Rules** block (positional assertion, not just a presence check). This proves the rule reaches every mode, not just the ones explicitly touched by this story.
- **`test_code_velocity_mode_separates_llm_lane_from_developer_lane`** — end-to-end render of `code_velocity`. Asserts both lane headers are present; the developer-lane header contains the "do NOT prompt for, offer, or initiate" load-bearing language; `"Direct commits to main"` appears *after* the developer-lane header (positional check, not just presence); and the LLM-lane header comes before the developer-lane header.
- **`test_code_velocity_present_step_forbids_followup_prompts`** — asserts step 9's tightened language is present with two pinned substrings (`"Do not propose commits"` and `'want me to also'`).
- **`test_code_test_first_present_step_forbids_followup_prompts`** — same assertion for `code_test_first`'s step 8. Ensures the Present-step tightening propagates to both code modes.
- All four new tests pass; full suite **266 passed** (was 248; +18 = 14 parametrized + 3 code-mode + 1 from the count arithmetic). Ruff clean. No production code changed — this is a template-instruction fix only, so no mypy delta to report.

### Notes
- **Audit result**: manually grepped every bundled mode template for the "LLM/developer lane mixing" pattern. One orphan was discovered: **`production-mode.md`** (a transition checklist template that is NOT wired to any mode in `.metadata.yml` — dead code that never renders to any `go.md`). Its "Production Mode Transition Checklist" bullets mix LLM-lane and developer-lane items in an unlabeled list, but because the template is not included in any rendered guide, it cannot trigger the bug. Scope-gated to "defer" per the M.g story's out-of-scope clause — a separate follow-up story should either wire `production-mode.md` into `.metadata.yml` with the two-lane restructure or delete it as confirmed dead code. Flagged here for provenance.
- **`document-brand-mode.md:385`** uses the good pattern already (`**Manual Updates (developer must do):**`). No fix needed; confirmed during the audit as the reference for how to label developer-lane sections.
- **`document-landing-mode.md:56`** uses a `**Note:**` callout for a developer-side action. Also confirmed acceptable during the audit.
- **Known limitation**: this fix addresses the *instruction*-level cause of the overreach. It does not prevent an LLM from ignoring the rule anyway — nothing short of a tool-side hook can do that. The rule is a strong nudge, not a hard gate. An LLM that has been conditioned elsewhere to offer commits can still override the rule; the fix substantially raises the cost of doing so (by putting the rule in front of the LLM on every read, in every mode) but does not make it impossible.
- **Phase M is now complete for real this time** (`v2.3.0`–`v2.3.6`). Seven stories shipped: M.a through M.f as previously enumerated, plus M.g (this story) which closes a bug the first six stories introduced by implication. The lifecycle wiring, the render hook, the validator, and now the approval-gate discipline are all in place.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Phase M documentation pass** (Story M.f) — the `project-essentials.md` artifact that landed in v2.3.0 and the three planning-mode wirings that landed in v2.3.2 / v2.3.3 / v2.3.4 are now reflected across all user-facing documentation and cross-referenced from the other artifact templates:
  - **`project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/concept.md`** — the existing "see also" sentence in the header gains a fourth cross-reference to `project-essentials.md` with a one-line description of what belongs there ("workflow rules, hidden coupling, tool-wrapper conventions that the LLM would otherwise random-walk on").
  - **`project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/features.md`** — same cross-reference added to the "see also" sentence.
  - **`project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/tech-spec.md`** — same cross-reference, with an additional one-line note that `plan_tech_spec` populates it after the tech-spec is approved (so the developer knows the capture flow is automatic, not manual).
  - **`project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/stories.md`** — same cross-reference, with a one-line note that `plan_phase` appends to it per phase.
  - **`project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/default-mode.md`** — the "Planning (sequence)" table's `plan_tech_spec` and `plan_phase` rows now mention the `project-essentials.md` side-effect. A new **"Refactoring (cycle)"** section was added to the "All Available Modes" table (previously missing entirely — Refactoring modes were listed in the README but not in the bundled default-mode template). The new `refactor_plan` row explicitly mentions the terminal-step project-essentials refresh.
  - **`README.md` — `### Planning Modes` table** — same `plan_tech_spec` and `plan_phase` updates as above.
  - **`README.md` — `### Refactoring Modes` table** — `refactor_plan` row rewritten from the vague "Plan a refactor" to the specific "Update `concept`/`features`/`tech-spec` for new capabilities or legacy migration; terminal step refreshes `project-essentials.md` (creates it for legacy projects)".
  - **`docs/site/user-guide/modes.md`** — full reference entries rewritten for `plan_tech_spec`, `plan_phase`, and `refactor_plan`:
    - `plan_tech_spec` now lists two **Artifacts** (was one) and explains the post-approval capture flow with the "skip if none" escape hatch called out.
    - `plan_phase` now lists three **Artifacts** (was two) and explains the terminal append step with the append-only-semantics rationale (`refactor_plan`'s Final Step is where you refactor essentials, not here).
    - `refactor_plan` now lists a **Artifact** field (was none) and explains the terminal "Revisit Project Essentials" step with all five refactor-specific framing categories visible in the prose. Legacy projects are explicitly flagged as the highest-value capture moment.

### Notes
- **Phase M is now complete** (`v2.3.0`–`v2.3.5`). Six stories shipped: M.a render hook + artifact template + dogfooding, M.b post-render placeholder validator, M.c `plan_tech_spec` create-wiring, M.d `refactor_plan` modify-wiring (terminal step), M.e `plan_phase` modify-wiring (append-only), and M.f (this documentation pass). The M.a render hook reads `<spec_artifacts_path>/project-essentials.md` at render time and injects its content under a `## Project Essentials` section in every rendered `go.md` via the `{% if project_essentials %}` guard in `_header-common.md`. The three planning modes populate, refresh, and append to the file at their respective lifecycle touchpoints. The M.b validator catches any future template edit that breaks the render pipeline (including removing the guard, typo-ing a context variable, or forgetting to update `render.py` when adding a new template variable).
- **Documentation-only release.** No code or test changes. All 248 tests continue to pass unchanged (`pyve test`). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on all unchanged production modules.
- **Cross-reference scope**: only the four artifact templates that form the standard planning-doc chain (`concept.md`, `features.md`, `tech-spec.md`, `stories.md`) get the new cross-reference to `project-essentials.md`. `brand-descriptions.md` is a documentation artifact, not a planning doc, and was deliberately not touched — keeping that artifact's header focused on brand-specific cross-references.
- **Implicit verification via the M.c / M.d / M.e end-to-end tests**: the story's "verify by running each of the three updated planning modes against a fresh fixture" checklist item is covered by the existing `test_plan_tech_spec_mode_prompts_for_project_essentials`, `test_refactor_plan_mode_prompts_for_project_essentials_revisit`, and `test_plan_phase_mode_prompts_for_project_essentials_append` tests in `tests/test_render.py`. Each runs `init` + `mode <name>` against a fresh `CliRunner.isolated_filesystem()` and asserts the prompt content. Re-running these three tests as part of the full suite (248 passed) is the verification — no separate fixture test added.
- **What this phase leaves on the table for a future phase**: none. Phases K / L / M are all complete and ready for the next `archive_stories` run. When that happens, `stories.md` will be archived to `.archive/stories-v2.3.5.md` and a fresh empty `stories.md` will be re-rendered for the next phase.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **`plan_phase` mode appends to `project-essentials.md`** (Story M.e) — wires the third and final planning mode to the M.a render hook, completing the M.c/M.d/M.e lifecycle coverage. Where M.c populates on initial tech-spec creation and M.d revisits on refactor, M.e runs once per new phase plan and **appends** (rather than revisits or rewrites) new must-know facts to the file. The append-only semantics are a deliberate design constraint — `plan_phase` runs frequently over a project's lifetime and should not be the place to refactor or reorder existing project-essentials content; that's `refactor_plan`'s Final Step job.
- **New step 7 in `plan-phase-mode.md`** appended after Step 6 (stories approval), runs **once** at the end of phase planning (not per-story). Structure:
  - **Create-if-absent branch**: if `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` doesn't exist (legacy project), the mode creates it from the artifact template first, following the same create path as `refactor_plan`'s Final Step. Legacy projects are explicitly flagged as the highest-value case.
  - **Modify branch**: if the file exists, the mode reads it, keeps the current content in mind for the phase-specific prompt, and appends new `###` subsections under appropriate categories.
  - **Phase-specific worked examples** with framing appropriate to "adding capability to an existing codebase": new architecture boundary (example cites Phase K's action-type registration pattern); new workflow rule or CLI contract (example cites Phase L's `--no-input` error-message contract that downstream tools pin); new hidden coupling between files (example cites Phase M's own `_header-common.md` guard + M.b validator); new deferred-but-documented item.
  - **Principle anchor**: "if the phase introduced a new *invariant* or *convention* that someone working in this codebase a year from now would waste an hour rediscovering, it belongs in project-essentials." Straightforward feature additions with no new invariants should skip this step.
  - **Skip-if-none escape hatch** is explicit — not every phase introduces new must-know facts.
  - **Append-only semantics** are explicit: "append (do not rewrite or reorder)". Add new `###` subsections under the appropriate category (or create a new category if none fits). Do not edit existing content.
  - **Heading convention reminder** (no top-level `#`; `###` for subsections) is present so the append nests correctly under the wrapper's `## Project Essentials`.
- **`plan_phase` metadata entry** now declares three `artifacts` (was two): `new-phase-{{phase_name}}.md` (no action — document artifact), `stories.md` (`action: modify`), and the new `project-essentials.md` (`action: modify`). The new wiring does not disturb the existing two declarations — the M.e story's test explicitly guards against that regression.

### Changed
- **`{% raw %}...{% endraw %}` escape on the "hidden coupling" worked example** in `plan-phase-mode.md`. The example references `_header-common.md`'s `{% if project_essentials %}` guard literally inside a backtick code span — without the `{% raw %}` escape, Jinja2 parses the literal as an actual tag and the render fails with `Unexpected end of template`. This is the first time any bundled template has needed `{% raw %}` escaping, and it's a useful datapoint for the M.b validator's known-limitation note (templates that want to emit literal `{{ var }}` or `{% ... %}` strings need `{% raw %}`). Discovered during the first M.e test run; documented inline in the template.

### Tests
- **2 new tests in `tests/test_render.py`** under the "Story M.e" heading:
  - `test_plan_phase_mode_prompts_for_project_essentials_append` — end-to-end render. Asserts: append step present and runs once; append-only semantics explicit ("do not rewrite or reorder"); create-if-absent branch present with legacy-project framing; at least two phase-specific worked example categories (architecture boundary, workflow rule / CLI contract); skip-if-none escape hatch; artifact template reference; heading convention reminder.
  - `test_plan_phase_metadata_declares_project_essentials_modify_artifact` — loads bundled metadata, asserts exactly one `project-essentials.md` artifact with `ActionType.MODIFY`. Also sanity-checks that the existing `new-phase-*.md` and `stories.md` declarations are still present, guarding against a clobber regression.
- **`test_every_mode_renders_successfully` parametrized test continues to pass unchanged** — and was specifically what caught the missing `{% raw %}` escape on the first run, since the `plan_phase` mode render failed until the escape was added.

### Notes
- **Phase M wiring is now complete** (M.c/M.d/M.e). All three planning modes populate, refresh, or append to `project-essentials.md` at their respective lifecycle touchpoints:
  - `plan_tech_spec` → `action: create` (initial population after tech-spec approval)
  - `refactor_plan` → `action: modify` (terminal revisit, create-if-legacy, refresh-if-exists)
  - `plan_phase` → `action: modify` (append-only, create-if-legacy)
  - All three use concrete worked examples with lifecycle-specific framing (initial / refactor-driven / phase-driven). All three have end-to-end render tests and metadata wiring tests. All three follow the heading convention that lets the content nest under `_header-common.md`'s `## Project Essentials` wrapper.
- **What M.f (next and final Phase M story) adds**: a documentation pass — README / modes catalogue / CHANGELOG consolidation. No code changes; just closes out Phase M.
- Full test suite: **248 passed** (+2 new M.e tests). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on the unchanged production modules (no code changes in this story).
- Verified end-to-end by running `pyve run project-guide update && pyve run project-guide mode plan_phase` in this repo. The rendered `go.md` contains the new step 7 at the expected position (after the stories-approval step 6) AND the M.a-injected `## Project Essentials` section at the top. The `{% if project_essentials %}` literal inside the worked example renders correctly (line 162 of the rendered output), confirming the `{% raw %}` escape works.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **`refactor_plan` mode refreshes `project-essentials.md`** (Story M.d) — wires the second of the three planning modes to the M.a render hook. When a refactor updates concept/features/tech-spec, the mode now runs a terminal "Revisit Project Essentials" sequence to capture any new must-know facts the refactor introduced. Distinct from M.c's `plan_tech_spec` (initial-lifecycle path) and M.e's upcoming `plan_phase` (per-phase append) in two ways: (1) it runs **once** per refactor session, not per-document, and (2) it handles both the **create** case (legacy project being migrated to v2.x, no file exists yet) and the **modify** case (project already has the file).
- **New "Final Step: Revisit Project Essentials" section** in `refactor-plan-mode.md`, appended after Step 8 (Cleanup). Structured as a 4-step sub-sequence to keep the decision path explicit:
  - **Step F.1: Check for Existing File** — branches on whether `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` exists. The legacy-project branch is explicitly flagged as the highest-value case, because these projects typically have *never had their conventions written down* — their developers have internalized the rules and forgotten they're non-obvious.
  - **Step F.2: Ask the Refactor-Revisit Prompt** — five concrete worked examples with *refactor-specific* framing (not M.c's initial-lifecycle framing): switched or added an environment manager (`pyve`/`uv`/`poetry`/`hatch`); split runtime from dev environment with the `pip install -e '.[dev]'` anti-pattern explicitly called out; renamed module or moved source-of-truth; changed domain conventions (money float → cents); new auto-generated or hidden-coupling files. Anchored by the **fork-in-the-road principle**: if the refactor introduced a decision where the *wrong* choice still "works" (runs, compiles, passes some tests), that is a project-essential. Each worked example includes a fully-rendered "*Example:*" sentence so the LLM can put concrete language in front of the developer, not abstract category names.
  - **Step F.3: Generate or Update the File** — explicit create vs modify branching. Legacy projects get a fresh file from the artifact template; existing projects get an in-place update that preserves-updates-adds. Both paths re-iterate the heading convention (no top-level `#`; `###` for subsections).
  - **Step F.4: Approval** — show the developer what was added, modified, and preserved, so the diff is legible.
- **"Skip if there are none" escape hatch** is part of Step F.2, explicitly framed for the pure-doc-restructure case where no tool/architecture/convention change occurred. A pure reformat is a legitimate refactor and should not be forced to produce project-essentials content.
- **`refactor_plan` metadata entry** now declares a single `artifacts` list (was previously empty) containing `project-essentials.md` with `action: modify`. The `modify` action type is the *conversational escape hatch* for the create-if-absent case: the deterministic action doesn't fire if the file doesn't exist, so the LLM's Step F.1 branching is what handles the create path in prose. The `action: modify` declaration is still correct at the metadata level because the *intent* is to end up with a modified (or newly-created) file.

### Tests
- **2 new tests in `tests/test_render.py`** under the "Story M.d" heading:
  - `test_refactor_plan_mode_prompts_for_project_essentials_revisit` — end-to-end render test. Fresh `init` → `mode refactor_plan` → read `go.md`. Asserts the terminal section is present and runs once (not per-document); the create/modify branches are both visible; the legacy-project framing is explicit; at least one concrete worked example with environment-manager naming is present; the artifact template path is referenced; the heading convention reminder is emitted; the "skip if none" escape hatch is present; and the fork-in-the-road / "wrong choice still works" principle is visible (refactor-framing anchor).
  - `test_refactor_plan_metadata_declares_project_essentials_modify_artifact` — loads the bundled metadata, gets the `refactor_plan` mode, and asserts exactly one `project-essentials.md` artifact with `ActionType.MODIFY`. The "exactly one" check is deliberate — a duplicate declaration from a copy-paste mistake would be silently accepted by the schema but would break the conversational handoff.
- **`test_every_mode_renders_successfully` parametrized test continues to pass unchanged** — the new terminal section introduces no undefined-variable placeholders (validated by the M.b post-render validator) and the new metadata wiring does not break rendering for any of the 14 modes.

### Notes
- **Design choice — terminal step vs cycle step**: the M.d story offered two options ("add a cycle step OR extend Step 1"). I chose a terminal step (new "Final Step: Revisit Project Essentials" section appended after Step 8). Rationale: `refactor_plan`'s main cycle processes three documents (concept, features, tech-spec) one at a time — asking about project-essentials once per document would be annoying and redundant, because most of the meaningful facts a refactor introduces are cross-document (a new tool wrapper affects how you run everything, not just how you build one artifact). Running the prompt once at the end gives the developer the full refactor context and produces a cleaner essentials file.
- **Terminology for metadata `action: modify`**: refactor_plan runs `action: modify` even though the file may not exist (legacy projects). This is the design pattern already established by `plan_phase`'s `stories.md` artifact in the bundled metadata — `modify` declares the intent ("end up with a modified file") and the mode template handles the create-if-absent case conversationally. The deterministic action handler in `actions.py` does NOT fire for `modify` actions — those go through the LLM. Only `archive` actions fire deterministically (via the `archive-stories` CLI command). So `modify` on a nonexistent file is not a runtime error; it's an instruction to the LLM.
- Full test suite: **246 passed** (+2 new M.d tests). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on `project_guide/render.py`.
- Verified end-to-end by running `pyve run project-guide update && pyve run project-guide mode refactor_plan` in this repo. The rendered `go.md` contains all four sub-steps (F.1 through F.4) in the expected terminal position AND the M.a-injected `## Project Essentials` section at the top — proving the two layers compose correctly for this cycle-type mode as well.
- **M.e (next story)** will take the same pattern into `plan_phase` with an *append-only* variant: rather than revisit or refresh, the prompt asks what *new* facts the phase introduces and appends them. Also uses `action: modify`. After M.e ships, all three planning modes (M.c/M.d/M.e) will populate `project-essentials.md` at their respective lifecycle touchpoints.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **`plan_tech_spec` mode populates `project-essentials.md`** (Story M.c) — wires the first of the three planning modes to the M.a render hook. After the developer approves the tech-spec, the mode now asks whether any must-know facts should be captured for future LLMs working on the project, with concrete worked examples in the prompt (not just abstract category names). If the developer provides facts, the mode generates `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` from the artifact template; if not, the file is not created (an empty file is deliberately avoided on fresh projects — the "skip if none" escape hatch is explicit).
- **New step 5 in `plan_tech_spec` mode template** at `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/plan-tech-spec-mode.md`: "After tech-spec approval, capture project essentials." The prompt lists five categories (workflow rules, architecture quirks, domain conventions, hidden coupling, dogfooding/meta notes) and provides concrete worked examples for each — in particular, the *tool wrapper random walk* anti-pattern (Python invocation, dev tool installation, test invocation) that the story's implementation strategy explicitly calls out as the highest-value category to capture.
- **New step 6 in the same mode**: generate `project-essentials.md` from the artifact template when the developer provides facts. The step explicitly reminds the LLM to follow the template's heading convention (no top-level `#`; `###` for subsections) so the content nests correctly under the `## Project Essentials` wrapper injected by `_header-common.md`.
- **`plan_tech_spec` metadata entry** now declares two `artifacts` (was one): `tech-spec.md` + `project-essentials.md`, both with `action: create`. The `create` action type is correct here because `plan_tech_spec` is the initial-lifecycle population path; `refactor_plan` (M.d) and `plan_phase` (M.e) will use `modify`/`modify` since those run against existing projects where the file may already exist.

### Tests
- **2 new tests in `tests/test_render.py`** under the "Story M.c" heading:
  - `test_plan_tech_spec_mode_prompts_for_project_essentials` — end-to-end render test. Fresh `init` → `mode plan_tech_spec` → read `go.md`. Asserts the capture step is present and ordered after tech-spec approval, at least one concrete worked example (`pyve run python` or `poetry run python`) is visible, two category names (`Workflow rules`, `Architecture quirks`) appear, the "skip if none" escape hatch is present, the artifact template path is referenced, and the heading convention reminder ("do NOT include a top-level", `###`) is emitted.
  - `test_plan_tech_spec_metadata_declares_project_essentials_artifact` — loads the bundled `.metadata.yml`, gets the `plan_tech_spec` mode, and asserts both `tech-spec.md` and `project-essentials.md` are declared as artifacts with the `project-essentials.md` artifact using `ActionType.CREATE`. This is the wiring checkpoint that M.d/M.e will deliberately diverge from.
- **`test_every_mode_renders_successfully` parametrized test continues to pass unchanged** — the new prompt content and the new metadata entry do not introduce any undefined-variable placeholders (validated by the M.b post-render validator) and do not break rendering for any of the 14 modes.

### Notes
- The `create` action type on the new artifact is an **intent declaration**, not an unconditional file-creation. The mode template's step 5 "skip to step 7 if there are no facts to capture" clause is the LLM-runtime escape hatch — a fresh project where the developer has nothing to put in `project-essentials.md` does NOT get an empty file. This is a deliberate design choice: empty files would trigger the render hook's "whitespace-only = omit section" branch (which is correct) but would leave a dormant empty file in `docs/specs/` that looks like an oversight. Better to not create it at all.
- Full test suite: **244 passed** (+2 new M.c tests). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on `project_guide/render.py`.
- Verified end-to-end by running `pyve run project-guide update && pyve run project-guide mode plan_tech_spec` in this repo. The rendered `go.md` contains both the M.a-injected Project Essentials section at the top (fed by this project's own `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`) and the new M.c capture step at step 5 — proving the two layers compose correctly on a project that already has the file populated.
- **What M.d and M.e add next**: M.d (`refactor_plan`) adds the same prompt with a "refactor-driven changes" framing and handles the legacy-project case where `project-essentials.md` does not yet exist; declares `action: modify` so the mode can either create-if-absent or modify-if-present. M.e (`plan_phase`) adds an append-only variant that runs once per new phase plan; also declares `action: modify`. M.c/M.d/M.e are mutually independent (per the phase plan in `docs/specs/stories.md`) but the listed order matches the project lifecycle.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Post-render placeholder validator** (Story M.b) — generalizes the M.a `{{ project_essentials }}` regression guard into a project-wide safeguard. After every `render_go_project_guide` call, the rendered output is scanned for any bare `{{ identifier }}` Jinja-style placeholder; if any are found, `RenderError` is raised with the offending names and a fix hint, and the output file is **not** written. This catches three distinct failure modes at the same place:
  1. **Missed intents** — a context variable that should have been set in `render.py` but wasn't.
  2. **Typos** — a template referencing `{{ project_essentialss }}` or any other misspelled variable name.
  3. **Removed guards** — a future edit that drops a `{% if %}` wrapper and lets an unset variable leak through.
- **`_UNRENDERED_PLACEHOLDER_RE` module-level regex** (`render.py`): `\{\{\s*([a-zA-Z_]\w*)\s*\}\}`. Matches exactly the shape that `_LenientUndefined.__str__` emits — `{{var}}`, `{{ var }}`, `{{  var  }}`. Deliberately does **not** match attribute access (`{{ obj.attr }}`), filters (`{{ name|upper }}`), expressions (`{{ a + 1 }}`), or statement blocks (`{% ... %}`). Those shapes raise at Jinja render time and never reach the validator.
- **`_validate_no_unrendered_placeholders(rendered)` helper** (`render.py`): scans the rendered output, deduplicates offenders while preserving first-occurrence order, and raises `RenderError` with a message of the form `Unrendered placeholder(s) in rendered output: <names>. Hint: check (1) render.py context variables and (2) template variable spellings.`. The validator is called inside `render_go_project_guide` **after** `template.render()` and **before** `output_path.write_text()`, so a failing render leaves the filesystem untouched.

### Changed
- **`_LenientUndefined` contract documented inversion**: the class itself is unchanged (still emits `{{ name }}` for undefined variables), but its *purpose* has inverted. Before M.b, the placeholder shape was the final output — a permissive pass-through so unset variables wouldn't crash renders. After M.b, the placeholder shape is the *detection signal* — lenient undefined produces the shape that the post-render validator catches and promotes to an error. The class stays lenient so the validator can see and report every offender in one pass, rather than Jinja crashing on the first undefined variable it encounters.
- **`test_render_undefined_vars_are_preserved` renamed to `test_render_undefined_vars_raise_render_error`** and inverted to assert the new behavior: undefined variables now raise `RenderError` with the offending name, and no output file is written.

### Removed
- **Temporary M.a regression guard `test_project_essentials_never_renders_literal_placeholder`** — the general validator subsumes it. If the `{% if %}` guard on `_header-common.md` is ever removed, the M.b validator raises `RenderError` on every mode render that has no populated `project-essentials.md`, which is far louder than a single dedicated test. A comment in the test file marks the removal for future readers.

### Tests
- **7 new tests in `tests/test_render.py`** under the "Story M.b" heading:
  - `test_validator_raises_on_single_undefined_variable` — baseline: one typo'd variable → `RenderError` citing the name.
  - `test_validator_error_message_lists_all_offenders` — three distinct offenders → error message names all three (no first-match short-circuit).
  - `test_validator_deduplicates_repeated_offenders` — a name repeated 3× → appears exactly once in the message, in first-occurrence order.
  - `test_validator_error_message_includes_fix_hint` — message contains both "render.py context variables" and "template variable spellings".
  - `test_validator_does_not_write_output_on_failure` — the output file must not exist after a raise (pre/post `exists()` assertions).
  - `test_validator_passes_when_all_vars_defined` — happy path: the standard `template_dir` fixture renders cleanly and the rendered file contains zero matching placeholders.
  - `test_validator_passes_on_template_with_no_jinja_variables` — empty-match edge case: a minimal plain-text template renders without raising.
- **Existing `test_every_mode_renders_successfully` parametrized test continues to pass unchanged.** This is the critical cross-template audit: every bundled mode is rendered through a fresh `CliRunner.isolated_filesystem()` install and must now pass the validator. All 14 modes pass, confirming that no bundled template references an undefined variable. This replaces the manual "audit existing templates" step in the M.b story checklist with an empirical proof.

### Notes
- **Audit result**: every bundled mode template's bare `{{ var }}` is backed by either a `render.py` context variable (`mode_name`, `mode_info`, `mode_description`, `sequence_or_cycle`, `next_mode`, `target_dir`, `project_essentials`) or a `metadata.common` entry (`test_invocation`, `spec_artifacts_path`, `web_root`). No mode template `{% include %}`s an artifact template, so artifact-template placeholders like `{{problem_statement}}` never enter the mode render path — they go through a separate `perform_archive` path in `actions.py` with its own `_LenientUndefined`, which is unchanged by this story.
- **Known limitation** (documented inline in `_UNRENDERED_PLACEHOLDER_RE`'s docstring): templates that legitimately want to emit a literal `{{ var }}` string (e.g., documentation of Jinja syntax inside a code fence) will trigger false positives. Not currently a problem in any bundled template; bridge if/when needed, likely via a `{% raw %}` escape.
- Full test suite: **242 passed** (+7 new M.b tests, −1 removed M.a guard, 1 renamed). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on `project_guide/render.py`.
- Verified end-to-end by re-rendering `docs/project-guide/go.md` under `default` and `plan_concept` modes per the story checklist. Both produce zero unrendered placeholders (confirmed via grep of the output).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **`project-essentials.md` artifact and render hook** (Story M.a) — a new per-project artifact that captures must-know facts future LLMs need to avoid blunders (workflow rules, architecture quirks, domain conventions, hidden coupling, dogfooding notes). When present and non-empty, its content is injected verbatim under a `## Project Essentials` section in **every** rendered mode via `_header-common.md`, making the facts visible no matter which mode the developer is in. This story lays the rails; the `plan_tech_spec` / `refactor_plan` / `plan_phase` modes will be wired to populate it in stories M.c–M.e.
- **`project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/project-essentials.md`** — the new artifact template. Ships as a comment-block-only file documenting what belongs there (workflow rules with concrete examples, architecture quirks, domain conventions, hidden coupling, dogfooding notes) and explicitly noting that an empty file is acceptable. The template deliberately omits a top-level `#` heading — the wrapper in `_header-common.md` provides the `## Project Essentials` heading, and content uses `###` for subsections to nest cleanly.
- **`_read_project_essentials()` helper in `project_guide/render.py`** — reads `<spec_artifacts_path>/project-essentials.md` (resolved from `metadata.common["spec_artifacts_path"]`, typically `docs/specs`). Returns an empty string when the path is missing, the file does not exist, or the file is whitespace-only. `render_go_project_guide` now calls this helper and passes the result as the `project_essentials` Jinja2 context variable.
- **`{% if project_essentials %}` guard in `_header-common.md`** — renders the `## Project Essentials` section (with the file's content and a `---` separator) only when the variable is non-empty. Empty/missing files omit the section entirely, so projects that don't want to maintain this file render cleanly.
- **`docs/specs/project-essentials.md` for this project** (dogfooding) — populated with the current must-know facts: pyve two-environment workflow rules (`pyve run` / `pyve test` / `pyve testenv run`), the dogfooding rule (edit templates in `project_guide/templates/project-guide/`, never `docs/project-guide/`), v2 mode-driven architecture, the Phase K release-lifecycle pattern, the Phase L `--no-input` contract, and the commit/version style conventions.

### Tests
- **6 new tests in `tests/test_render.py`** under the "Story M.a" heading, all using a new `essentials_template_dir` fixture that faithfully reproduces the `{% if %}` guard shape and a new `essentials_metadata` fixture with `spec_artifacts_path`:
  - `test_project_essentials_rendered_when_file_non_empty` — populated file → section appears between the header and the mode body.
  - `test_project_essentials_omitted_when_file_empty` — zero-length file → section omitted.
  - `test_project_essentials_omitted_when_file_whitespace_only` — whitespace-only file → section omitted (treated as empty).
  - `test_project_essentials_omitted_when_file_missing` — no file at all → section omitted, no error.
  - `test_project_essentials_omitted_when_spec_artifacts_path_not_in_metadata` — minimal metadata without `spec_artifacts_path` → lookup is skipped, section omitted.
  - `test_project_essentials_never_renders_literal_placeholder` — **temporary regression guard** (scheduled for removal by M.b once the general post-render placeholder validator lands). Exercises all four file shapes and asserts the literal string `{{ project_essentials }}` never appears in the output. Catches a future template edit that removes the `{% if %}` guard, since `_LenientUndefined.__str__` would otherwise render the placeholder verbatim. See `render.py:83-99` for the lenient-undefined contract.

### Notes
- The M.a story deliberately does **not** add `project-essentials.md` to any mode's `.metadata.yml` `artifacts` list — that wiring is M.c–M.e's responsibility (population via `plan_tech_spec`, refresh via `refactor_plan`, append via `plan_phase`). M.a only establishes the render-time lookup, the guarded section, and the dogfooded content for this project.
- The existing `test_every_mode_renders_successfully` parametrized test continues to pass unchanged. It runs every bundled mode through an isolated filesystem where no `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` exists, so the section is omitted and the render produces valid output — this is the implicit cross-mode regression guard.
- Full test suite: **236 passed** (`pyve test`). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on `project_guide/render.py`.
- Verified end-to-end by re-rendering `docs/project-guide/go.md` under both `default` and `code_velocity` modes; the `## Project Essentials` section appears between the `**Rules**` block and the mode heading, with the `###` subsection nesting rendering correctly.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **MkDocs commands reference catch-up for `archive-stories`** (Story L.d) — closes a K.g documentation carryover gap discovered during the L.c documentation pass. The `archive-stories` CLI command shipped in v2.1.3 (Story K.d), and the K.g docs pass (v2.1.6) updated the README's Command Reference, `modes.md`, `workflow.md`, and `default-mode.md` — but `docs/site/user-guide/commands.md` was not on the K.g checklist, so the MkDocs command reference still reflected the pre-v2.1.3 command surface. Rather than retroactively patch the closed Phase K, this fix rolls forward as Phase L's final story.
  - `docs/site/user-guide/commands.md` line 3: "eight commands" → "nine commands".
  - Command Overview table: new `archive-stories` row, inserted between `mode` and `status` to match the README's Command Reference ordering (post-release/lifecycle commands group with `mode` rather than with the file-sync commands).
  - New `## archive-stories` section placed after `## mode` and before `## status`. Content adapted from the canonical `README.md` `### archive-stories` section (which has the authoritative prose from K.g): synopsis, 5-step "What It Does" pipeline, "Failure Modes" (pre-check failure leaves workspace untouched; rollback on re-render failure), and "Usage" note explaining the conversational-vs-deterministic split between the `archive_stories` mode template and the CLI command.
- Verified: every command listed by `project-guide --help` (9 total: `archive-stories`, `init`, `mode`, `override`, `overrides`, `purge`, `status`, `unoverride`, `update`) now has both a row in the `commands.md` overview table and a dedicated `##` section. No other commands drift detected during the audit.

### Notes
- Documentation-only release. No code or test changes. All 230 tests continue to pass unchanged.
- Phase L (`v2.2.0`–`v2.2.3`) is now complete. The pyve post-hook integration path is fully unblocked, documented in both the README and MkDocs command references, and the MkDocs command surface now matches the CLI.
- **Provenance note for future docs-audit work:** this fix catches one specific K.g gap (the missing `archive-stories` content). It is deliberately *not* a general `commands.md` audit — any other drift in that file (stale counts, outdated output samples, etc.) was out of scope and should be tracked separately if discovered. The story's out-of-scope section in `docs/specs/stories.md` documents this boundary.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Phase L documentation pass** (Story L.c) — the unattended-use surface shipped in v2.2.0 (idempotent re-run) and v2.2.1 (`--no-input` flag + auto-detection) is now reflected across all user-facing documentation:
  - `README.md` — `### init` gets an "Unattended / CI use" subsection listing all four trigger mechanisms (`--no-input`, `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT`, `CI`, non-TTY stdin) with one example each, plus an "Idempotent re-run" paragraph calling out the exit-0 no-op behavior. The `--no-input` flag is documented in the `init` options list.
  - `docs/site/user-guide/commands.md` — `## init` gets a new "Idempotent Re-run" section and a full "Unattended / CI Use" section with a priority-order trigger table. The `--no-input` flag is documented in the options list and Examples block. The new sections also cite the `should_skip_input()` helper and `_require_setting()` contract in `project_guide/runtime.py` so anyone adding a future prompt knows where the plumbing lives.
  - `docs/specs/project-guide-no-input-spec.md` — status line updated from `Proposed (2026-04-10)` to `Implemented in v2.2.0–v2.2.1 (2026-04-11)` with one sentence each citing Story L.a (idempotent re-run) and Story L.b (`--no-input` + auto-detection + `_require_setting`).

### Notes
- This is a documentation-only release: no code or test changes. All 230 tests continue to pass unchanged. Phase L (`v2.2.0`–`v2.2.2`) is now complete; the pyve post-hook integration path is fully unblocked and documented.
- Known gap (out of scope for this release, not introduced by this phase): `docs/site/user-guide/commands.md` still says "eight commands" in its overview and does not document the `archive-stories` command added in v2.1.3. This is a K.g carryover — the K.g docs pass updated the README but not the MkDocs commands reference. Tracked for a follow-up pass.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **`--no-input` flag on `project-guide init`** (Story L.b) with env-var and non-TTY auto-detection. `init` is now safe to invoke from any unattended context (CI runners, `pyve` post-hooks, subprocess pipelines) without hanging on a future prompt.
- **`project_guide/runtime.py`** — new module exposing `should_skip_input(flag: bool = False) -> bool`. This is the single idiom every future prompt site in this package must use to decide whether it is safe to read from stdin. Trigger priority (first match wins):
  1. Explicit `flag` argument (usually `--no-input`).
  2. `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT` env var set to a truthy value.
  3. `CI` env var set to a truthy value.
  4. Non-TTY stdin (piped input, subprocess, closed stdin, `sys.stdin is None`).
  5. Otherwise: interactive.
  - Truthy env values are matched case-insensitively against `{"1", "true", "yes", "on"}`.
  - Subprocess safety: `AttributeError` (when `sys.stdin` is `None`) and `ValueError` (when stdin is closed) are caught and treated as non-TTY.
- **`_require_setting(name, cli_flag, env_var)` helper** in `runtime.py` — raises `click.ClickException` (exit code 1) with the exact message format `<name> is required when --no-input is active. Provide via --<cli_flag> or <env_var>.`. This is the landing spot for any future prompt site that has no sensible default under `--no-input`. No production prompt exercises this today; it exists so the contract is frozen *before* the first caller.
- **`init --no-input` click option** — boolean, default `False`, help text: `Do not read from stdin; use defaults where sensible. Fail loudly if any prompt has no default. (Also auto-enabled by CI=1 or non-TTY stdin.)`. The computed `skip_input = should_skip_input(no_input)` is threaded through `init` as reserved plumbing — today `init` has no interactive prompts, so the value is unused at runtime (marked `# noqa: F841` with a comment explaining why).

### Tests
- **`tests/test_runtime.py`** (new, 31 tests): baseline fixtures for a clean env + forced-TTY stdin; parametrized coverage of truthy and falsy `PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT` values; parametrized coverage of `CI` truthy values; non-TTY stdin; `sys.stdin is None` and closed-stdin subprocess edge cases; explicit priority-order tests (flag > env > CI > TTY); and `_require_setting` contract tests (exit code + exact message format).
- **`tests/test_cli.py`** (5 new tests under a Story L.b section): `test_init_with_no_input_flag_on_fresh_project`, `test_init_with_no_input_and_force_on_initialized_project`, `test_init_with_ci_env_var_is_idempotent_on_rerun` (composes L.a idempotency with L.b auto-detection), `test_init_with_non_tty_stdin_behaves_like_no_input`, and `test_require_setting_contract_exit_code_and_message` (registers a throwaway `@click.command` that calls `_require_setting` via `CliRunner` — this is the FR-L4 regression guard).

### Notes
- Full test suite: **230 passed** (`pyve test`). Ruff clean across `project_guide/` and `tests/`. mypy clean on the two modified production modules.
- The `skip_input` local in `init` is intentionally unused at present. It exists so that the day someone adds the first real prompt to `init`, the plumbing is already in place and the contract for handling missing required settings is already tested. Removing the `noqa` comment without adding a consumer would be a regression.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **`project-guide init` is now idempotent** (Story L.a) — re-running `init` on an already-initialized project is a silent exit-0 no-op instead of raising `click.Abort()` / exit 1. When `.project-guide.yml` already exists and `--force` was not given, `init` now prints `project-guide already initialized at <target_dir>/ (use --force to reinitialize).` and returns. The `--force` branch is unchanged: overwrite semantics still apply. This is the small behavioral fix that unblocks the `pyve` post-hook integration path — `project-guide init` can now be invoked unconditionally from automated flows (CI, scripts, `pyve init` post-hook) without hanging on an existing project. The `--no-input` flag, env-var (`PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT`, `CI`), and non-TTY auto-detection arrive in v2.2.1 (Story L.b).

### Tests
- `tests/test_cli.py::test_init_on_already_initialized_project_is_idempotent` (renamed from `test_init_with_existing_config_error`) — verifies exit 0 and the "already initialized" message on re-run without `--force`.
- `tests/test_cli.py::test_init_double_run_does_not_modify_files` — new regression guard: a second `init` run must not rewrite any tracked template file (verified via `st_mtime_ns` snapshots of `.project-guide.yml`, `.metadata.yml`, and two mode templates).
- `test_init_with_force_flag` is unchanged and still guards the `--force` overwrite branch.

### Notes
- Idempotency is based solely on `.project-guide.yml` presence. A partial-install state where the config is absent but the target directory is populated is out of scope (falls through to the existing `_copy_template_tree` skip-with-warnings path — documented in `phase-l-no-input-init-plan.md`).
- All 194 tests pass (`pyve test`). Ruff is clean on the changed files.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Phase K documentation pass** (Story K.g) — `archive_stories` mode is now reflected across all user-facing documentation:
  - `docs/site/user-guide/modes.md` — new "Post-Release Modes" section with a full `archive_stories` reference entry (Type, Next, Artifact, Prerequisites, the conversational-vs-deterministic split between the mode template and the `archive-stories` CLI command). The `plan_phase` entry now explains that it handles two `stories.md` shapes (populated and empty post-archive) and continues phase letters across the archive boundary. The Ongoing Project Flow bullet list gains an `archive_stories` entry.
  - `docs/site/user-guide/workflow.md` — new Post-Release bullet in the Modes section; new "When to Switch Modes" row for `archive_stories`; reference count updated from "15 modes" to "16 modes".
  - `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/default-mode.md` — new "Post-Release (sequence)" table in the "All Available Modes" section with `archive_stories`.
- **README updates**:
  - New "Post-Release Modes" table in the Available Modes section.
  - New `archive-stories` CLI command reference describing the 5-step archive pipeline, pre-check failure behavior, rollback-on-failure semantics, and the LLM-runs-after-developer-approval usage pattern.
  - Quick Start mode list: added `archive_stories` (and `project_scaffold`, which had been missing from this list in earlier versions).

### Changed
- **README Key Features**:
  - "15 modes" → "16 modes".
  - "Eight intuitive commands" → "Nine intuitive commands" (new `archive-stories` command).
  - "91% test coverage with 131 comprehensive tests" → "Comprehensive test coverage across CLI, rendering, and action modules" (drops hard-coded counts that went stale every story and will continue to drift).

### Notes
- Verified via `click.testing.CliRunner`: `project-guide --help` lists `archive-stories`; `project-guide mode` (after `init`) lists `archive_stories` in the mode catalogue; `project-guide archive-stories --help` works.
- All existing tests continue to pass unchanged (193). Phase K (`v2.1.0`–`v2.1.6`) is now complete.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Default mode "Suggesting the Next Step" section** (Story K.f) — `default-mode.md` now teaches the LLM to read `docs/specs/stories.md` (when present), check the status of every `### Story X.y: ... [<status>]` heading, and branch on three cases:
  - **All stories `[Done]`**: prompt the developer with both `archive_stories` (clean slate, archive then plan) and `plan_phase` (plan against history) as Option A and Option B, explaining the trade-off and including "Use this when:" guidance for each. Wait for the developer to choose before changing modes.
  - **At least one non-`[Done]`**: defer to the existing project lifecycle suggestions at the top of the mode (no behavior change).
  - **No `stories.md`**: direct the developer to `project-guide mode plan_concept` to begin the lifecycle.
- Detection happens at LLM read time (consistent with the v2 architecture — no Python-side check is added). The bundled mode template carries the prompt language for all three branches simultaneously.

### Tests
- No new tests; the existing parametrized `test_every_mode_renders_successfully` covers `default` and confirms the template still renders without errors. Manual verification via `runner.isolated_filesystem` confirms the rendered guide contains the all-Done section, both option labels, and the fresh-project hint.
- **193 tests pass** (unchanged from K.e).

## [2.1.4] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **`plan_phase` mode handles post-archive empty `stories.md`** (Story K.e):
  - Step 1 of the mode template now distinguishes two `stories.md` shapes — "Populated" (one or more `## Phase <Letter>:` sections) vs "Empty (post-archive)" (header + `## Future` only). For the empty case, the template instructs the LLM to look in `docs/specs/.archive/` for `stories-vX.Y.Z.md` files, read the highest-version one, and use its highest phase letter as the basis for the next.
  - Step 5 explicitly describes the next-phase-letter algorithm (populated → successor of highest; empty + archive → successor of archived highest; neither → start at `A`) and tells the LLM to insert the new phase as the first phase when `stories.md` was empty.
  - Phase letters **continue across the archive boundary** — they do not reset.
- **`increment_phase_letter(letter)` helper** in `actions.py` — pure function returning the base-26-no-zero successor of a phase letter. Examples: `A→B`, `Z→AA`, `AZ→BA`, `ZZ→AAA`. Raises `ActionError` on invalid input (empty string, lowercase, non-letter characters).
- **`next_phase_letter(stories_text, archive_dir)` helper** in `actions.py` — implements the post-archive lookup algorithm in Python so future tooling can call it directly (e.g., a future `status` command or a Python-driven `plan_phase` action). The current `plan_phase` mode template describes the same algorithm in prose so the LLM can perform it directly without invoking Python (consistent with v2 architecture).
- **`_find_latest_archived_stories(archive_dir)` helper** — filters `.archive/` to files matching `stories-vX.Y.Z.md` (any stem starting with `stories`), ignoring unrelated archived artifacts like `phase-j-modes-plan.md` or `ux-problems-v2.0.10.md`. Returns the file with the highest semver version, or `None` if none exist.

### Tests
- 16 new tests in `tests/test_actions.py`:
  - **`extract_stories_header_context`** — 3 tests (double-hyphen, em-dash, missing → empty dict).
  - **`increment_phase_letter`** — 7 tests covering simple advance, `Z→AA` carry, two-letter advance, `ZZ→AAA` carry, three-letter advance, and three invalid-input cases.
  - **`next_phase_letter`** — 6 fixture tests covering: populated stories.md returns successor (and ignores `.archive/`), empty stories.md + Phase J archive → `K` (using the real `docs/specs/.archive/stories-v2.0.20.md` fixture), empty stories.md + missing `.archive/` → `A`, empty + empty `.archive/` → `A`, empty + `.archive/` containing only non-stories files → `A`, and empty + multiple archived stories versions picks the highest-version one.
- **193 tests pass** (up from 177).

### Notes
- The `next_phase_letter` Python helper duplicates an algorithm that the LLM can also perform from the rendered mode template. The duplication is deliberate: the v2 architecture prefers LLM-driven detection at read time, but having a Python implementation tested against the same fixture means future code (a `status` validator, a Python-driven plan_phase, or an end-to-end test of the full archive→plan_phase flow) can rely on the algorithm without re-implementing it. The tests assert both implementations stay in sync via the Phase J fixture.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **`archive_stories` mode** (Story K.d) — new sequence-style mode productionizes the archive pipeline from K.a/K.c:
  - New mode template `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/archive-stories-mode.md` walks the LLM through reading the current `stories.md`, warning about any non-`[Done]` stories, showing the planned archive path, awaiting developer approval, running the archive command, and suggesting `plan_phase` as the next mode. Includes the `_phase-letters.md` shared include from K.b.
  - New `archive_stories` entry in `.metadata.yml` under the Post-Release section with `action: archive` on `stories.md`, `next_mode: plan_phase`, and a `files_exist: [stories.md]` prerequisite that surfaces a warning when the source is missing.
- **`project-guide archive-stories` CLI command** — new subcommand that wraps `project_guide.actions.perform_archive`. Loads the project's `.project-guide.yml`, looks up the `archive_stories` mode, finds its archive artifact, resolves the bundled `stories.md` template (always uses the package-bundled copy, not the project's installed templates, so the re-render is not affected by any local template edits), and invokes `perform_archive` with the merged metadata context. Prints a summary: archived path, version, last phase letter, and whether a Future section was carried.
- **`extract_stories_header_context(text)` helper** in `actions.py` — parses the stories.md first-line header (`# stories.md -- <project-name> (<programming-language>)`) into a context dict. `perform_archive` merges extracted values with the caller's context (caller wins) so the fresh re-render preserves the header even when the caller doesn't supply `project_name`/`programming_language` explicitly.

### Changed
- **`render_fresh_stories_artifact` uses lenient undefined rendering.** Missing Jinja context variables now render as `{{ name }}` placeholders instead of empty strings, preventing header corruption like `# stories.md --  (Python)` when a project's metadata doesn't include `project_name`. Implemented via a local `_LenientUndefined` class in `actions.py` (mirrors `render.py._LenientUndefined`; kept local to avoid an import cycle).

### Removed
- **`scripts/spike_archive_stories.py`** — the K.a throwaway script is now superseded by `project_guide.actions.perform_archive` + `project-guide archive-stories`. The empty `scripts/` directory was removed as well.

### Tests
- New `tests/test_archive_stories_mode.py` — 9 end-to-end integration tests using `click.testing.CliRunner`:
  - **Mode template rendering**: `mode archive_stories` renders a go.md containing the mode-specific content, the `project-guide archive-stories` command, the phase-letters include, and the `plan_phase` next-mode suggestion.
  - **Prerequisite warning**: missing `stories.md` surfaces the "Prerequisites not yet met" warning.
  - **Happy path**: `archive-stories` moves the source to `.archive/stories-v1.0.0.md`, preserves the source byte-for-byte, re-renders a fresh `stories.md` with carried Future section and preserved `demo-project` header.
  - **No-Future fallback**: source without a Future section falls back to the template default (HTML-comment explainer present).
  - **Error paths**: missing config, missing source, pre-existing archive target (idempotency guard), no versioned story headings. Each error path verifies the source is left untouched.
- **177 tests pass** (up from 168 after K.c refactor).

### Notes
- The mode template is LLM-conversational (read/warn/show/approve), but the actual mutation is Python-deterministic (`project-guide archive-stories` shelling to `perform_archive`). This keeps the file-mutation logic testable and transactional while the decision-making stays in the LLM conversation.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **`archive` artifact action type** (Story K.c) — new `project_guide/actions.py` module implements the deterministic archive pipeline:
  - `detect_latest_version(text)` — scans `### Story X.y: vN.N.N` headings and returns the numerically highest version (not lexical).
  - `detect_latest_phase_letter(text)` — scans `## Phase <Letter>:` headings using base-26-no-zero ordering (`A` < `Z` < `AA` < `ZZ` < `AAA`).
  - `extract_future_section(text)` — returns the `## Future` block verbatim to EOF, or `""` if absent.
  - `render_fresh_stories_artifact(template, context, future)` — re-renders the bundled `stories.md` artifact template with an empty body, substituting the template's default `## Future` block with a carried section when provided.
  - `perform_archive(source, template, context)` — end-to-end runtime: moves `source` to `<dirname>/.archive/<stem>-vX.Y.Z<suffix>`, re-renders a fresh source with Future preserved, best-effort rollback on failure. Returns `ArchiveResult(archived_to, source_rewritten, version, phase_letter, future_carried)`.
- **`ActionType` StrEnum** and **`Artifact` dataclass** in `project_guide/actions.py`. `ActionType.CREATE`/`MODIFY`/`ARCHIVE` are the canonical action values; `StrEnum` means `ActionType.ARCHIVE == "archive"` is `True`, so YAML round-trips as bare strings. `Artifact` is a typed, validated representation of a mode's artifact entry (`file | webpage | framework` + `action`).
- **`ActionError` exception** in `project_guide/exceptions.py` for archive action failures at runtime.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `ModeDefinition.artifacts` is now `list[Artifact]`, not `list[dict]`.** Every mode's `artifacts:` list is parsed into typed `Artifact` dataclass instances during metadata load. Consumers must use attribute access (`artifact.file`, `artifact.action`) instead of dict access (`artifact["file"]`). No CLI/runtime code in this package consumed the old dict shape, so this is only visible to tests and any future external integrations. Pre-release (Phase K) acceptable churn.
- **`metadata.py` validates artifact action values at load time** — any `action:` field on an artifact must be one of `ActionType.{CREATE,MODIFY,ARCHIVE}`. Artifacts without an `action:` field continue to be tolerated (legacy form). Typos like `action: arhive` now fail at metadata load time with a helpful error message listing valid values.

### Tests
- New `tests/test_actions.py` — 30 tests covering: ActionType enum and StrEnum behavior, Artifact dataclass parsing (file/webpage/framework targets, missing action, unknown action, non-mapping input), version/phase/future detection (including negative cases and base-26 ordering), fresh-render behavior, and a real-file round-trip against `.archive/stories-v2.0.20.md` (the Phase J archive).
- Updated tests in `tests/test_metadata.py` — 4 new tests verifying `action: archive` parses to `ActionType.ARCHIVE`, `action: create`/`modify` still parse, missing `action:` yields `artifact.action is None`, and unknown actions raise `MetadataError`. Existing tests updated to use attribute access on `Artifact`.
- **168 tests pass** (up from 133).

### Notes
- This story adds the action **type** only. Wiring the action into a CLI-invocable `archive_stories` mode (new mode template, metadata entry, and the mode command routing it to `perform_archive`) is the next story, K.d.
- The `ActionType`/`Artifact` refactor replaced an earlier in-progress design using bare string constants (`ACTION_CREATE`, `ACTION_MODIFY`, `ACTION_ARCHIVE`, `VALID_ARTIFACT_ACTIONS` frozenset) after a mid-story decision to prioritize code clarity over backward compatibility. No releases shipped with the string-constant form.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Phase and Story ID Scheme shared include** (Story K.b) — new template `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/modes/_phase-letters.md` documents the base-26-no-zero phase letter scheme (`A`–`Z`, `AA`–`ZZ`, `AAA`–…), the matching story sub-letter scheme, and the rule that letters continue across `archive_stories` boundaries by consulting `docs/specs/.archive/`. The include is now rendered once inside both `plan_stories` and `plan_phase` so the rules live in one place.
- **`## Future` section in the stories artifact template** — `project_guide/templates/project-guide/templates/artifacts/stories.md` now renders a `## Future` section after `{{phases_and_stories}}` with an inline note describing what belongs there (deferred stories, future phases, project-level out-of-scope items). This gives `archive_stories` a canonical place to preserve the "carry-over" section across archive cycles.
- **Tests**: two new tests in `tests/test_render.py` verify the artifact template renders a `## Future` section when `phases_and_stories` is empty and when it is populated (with the Future section appearing after the phases content). 133 tests pass.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Spike: archive_stories pipeline** (Story K.a) — throwaway script `scripts/spike_archive_stories.py` exercises the full archive flow end-to-end (latest-version detection, latest-phase-letter detection, `## Future` extraction, archive move, fresh `stories.md` re-render). Validates the critical path before the productionized `archive_stories` mode lands in K.c/K.d. Verified round-trip against a copy of `.archive/stories-v2.0.20.md` (Phase J file): archived file byte-matches the original, fresh `stories.md` contains the carried `## Future` section. Will be deleted in K.d once superseded.

## [2.0.20] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Renamed Jinja2 template source** `templates/go.md` → `templates/llm_entry_point.md`. The rendered output is still `go.md` (unchanged). This eliminates confusion when @-mentioning files in an LLM chat — there's now only one `go.md` (the rendered entry point the LLM reads).

### Added
- **Shell completion for `project-guide mode <TAB>`** — dynamically completes mode names from the active project's `.metadata.yml`. Click's built-in shell completion handles command names and flags automatically.
- Setup instructions for bash, zsh, and fish in [Installation Options](https://pointmatic.github.io/project-guide/user-guide/install-options/).

## [2.0.19] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **`update` no longer prompts for modified files** — files whose content differs from the bundled template are now auto-backed-up (`.bak.<timestamp>`) and overwritten without asking. The previous prompt was misleading because hash-based sync can't distinguish "user modified the file" from "the bundled template changed in this version" — both look identical.
- Use `project-guide override <file> <reason>` to lock files that should not be touched by `update`.
- Removed "Modified files detected" / "Skipped (user declined)" / "Updated (approved by user)" output sections.

### Removed
- `sync_files()` no longer returns a `modified` list — its 5-tuple is now a 4-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing)`. Files that previously went into `modified` now go into `updated` (with backups).
- `apply_file_update` is no longer used in `cli.py` (still exported from `sync.py` for internal use)

## [2.0.18] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`go.md` is no longer gitignored** — agentic LLMs that respect gitignore patterns couldn't read the rendered entry point, breaking the entire workflow. The file is now tracked in git, which also gives mode switches a useful git history footprint.
- **Mode heading bug** — planning mode templates rendered `# concept.md — {{ project_name }}` (with the literal Jinja2 placeholder, since `project_name` was never defined). Replaced with a single mode heading in `_header-common.md` that uses actual metadata: `# {{ mode_name }} mode ({{ sequence_or_cycle }})` followed by a `> {{ mode_info }}` blockquote.

### Changed
- `_ensure_gitignore_entry()` no longer adds `go.md` to `.gitignore` (only `*.bak.*` patterns remain)
- All 14 mode templates stripped of their individual H1 headings in favor of the centralized mode heading from `_header-common.md`

## [2.0.17] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Renamed `project_setup` mode to `project_scaffold`** — "setup" was too generic; "scaffold" matches the mode's actual purpose (creating project files) and industry conventions. Breaking change for anyone using `project-guide mode project_setup`.
- Renamed template file: `project-setup-mode.md` → `project-scaffold-mode.md`
- Slimmed down `docs/site/user-guide/workflow.md` from 376 lines to ~85 lines, removing duplication with getting-started, commands, and overrides pages

### Added
- `docs/site/user-guide/modes.md` — comprehensive reference for all 15 modes with type, prerequisites, artifacts, and Mode Flow diagram
- "When to Switch Modes" table and "The HITLoop Cycle" section in workflow guide

## [2.0.13] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- `status` command redesigned with grouped sections: Mode (with prerequisites), Guide, Files — each with contextual action prompts
- File sync now uses content hash comparison instead of version comparison — a version bump no longer marks unchanged files as stale
- `(installed: vX.X.X)` only shown in status when it differs from package version
- Prerequisites line omitted when the mode has none
- Renamed `go-project-guide.md` → `go.md` — shorter, easier to autocomplete

### Removed
- Version-based file freshness check — `compare_versions` no longer used by `status` or `sync_files`

## [2.0.12] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- `status` command redesigned: compact summary by default, per-file list only when problems exist
- Status header now shows `Target:` directory, mode on one line with description
- Added `--verbose` / `-v` flag to force full per-file list
- Status footer shows `Run 'project-guide mode' to see available modes.`
- Renamed "guides" to "files" throughout: the sync system tracks files, not guides
  - `--guides` CLI flag → `--files`
  - `GuideNotFoundError` → `ProjectFileNotFoundError`
  - `GuideOverride` → `FileOverride`
  - sync.py: `get_all_guide_names` → `get_all_file_names`, `copy_guide` → `copy_file`, `backup_guide` → `backup_file`, `apply_guide_update` → `apply_file_update`, `sync_guides` → `sync_files`
  - All user-facing strings updated

## [2.0.11] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Rendered `go-project-guide.md` now outputs to `docs/project-guide/` instead of `docs/specs/` — it's mode instructions, not a spec artifact
- Entry point template moved from `project-guide/go-project-guide.md` to `project-guide/templates/go-project-guide.md`
- Jinja2 loader simplified to search only the `templates/` subdirectory
- Developer instruction in `_header-common.md` updated to `Read docs/project-guide/go-project-guide.md`
- `.gitignore` entry updated to `docs/project-guide/go-project-guide.md`
- `target_dir` now available as a Jinja2 context variable in templates

## [2.0.10] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- `init` now starts in `default` mode instead of `plan_concept`
- `files_exist` prerequisites no longer include template paths that resolve to repo-internal locations; only user-created spec artifacts are checked

### Changed
- Renamed metadata file from `project-guide-metadata.yml` to `.metadata.yml` (hidden, shorter — already scoped by `project-guide/` directory)
- Added `metadata_file` field to `.project-guide.yml` config — CLI reads the metadata filename from config instead of hardcoding it
- Render errors now show actionable guidance: run `project-guide status` and `project-guide update`
- `sync.py` guide discovery now includes dotfiles (`.*.yml` pattern)

### Added
- Parametrized test that renders every mode from the bundled metadata — proves a fresh install works and catches regressions

## [2.0.9] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- New `refactor_plan` cycle mode — migrate planning artifacts (concept, features, tech-spec) to v2.x artifact template format
- New `refactor_document` cycle mode — migrate documentation artifacts (descriptions, landing page, MkDocs) to v2.x format
- v1.x → v2.x migration notice in `status` command when config version is "1.0" or target_dir is "docs/guides"

## [2.0.8] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- New `project_setup` mode -- one-time project scaffolding (LICENSE, copyright headers, package manifest, README with badges, CHANGELOG, .gitignore)
- `project-setup-mode.md` template with step-by-step setup instructions and approval checklist

### Changed
- `default-mode.md` slimmed to pure navigation -- project lifecycle overview with mode table, no setup instructions
- Mode flow updated: `default` -> `project_setup` -> `plan_concept` -> ... -> `code_velocity`
- `project_setup` added to `project-guide-metadata.yml` between `default` and `plan_concept`

## [2.0.7] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- 5 new tests for `mode` command (no config, list modes, invalid name, config update, render output)
- `mode` command added to README Command Reference

### Changed
- README updated for v2.0: new Quick Start with mode workflow, Available Modes table, updated config example, corrected test stats (112 tests, 92% coverage)
- Test coverage increased from 90% to 92% (112 tests, up from 107)

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- `default-mode.md` rewritten as a full project lifecycle overview (setup, planning, implementation) with links to specific modes -- serves as a friendly starting point for new users
- Distributed prerequisites from old default mode into appropriate planning modes:
  - Project idea -> `plan-concept-mode.md`
  - License preference, target audience, constraints -> `plan-features-mode.md`
  - Language/runtime, preferred frameworks -> `plan-tech-spec-mode.md`
- Added `default` mode to `project-guide-metadata.yml`

### Removed
- `best-practices-guide.md` -- content absorbed into `code-velocity-mode.md` and `code-test-first-mode.md`

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Brand descriptions artifact template (`templates/artifacts/brand-descriptions.md`)

### Fixed

- Updated all user-facing CLI messages to reference `project-guide`
- Updated guide template to reference `pip install project-guide` and `project-guide init`

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Renamed config file from `.project-guides.yml` to `.project-guide.yml`**
  - All CLI commands now read and write `.project-guide.yml`

  - User can accept or decline per-file — declined files are reported as skipped
  - `--force` flag skips the prompt, creates a `.bak` backup, and overwrites automatically
  - `--dry-run` shows modified files with a note that they would be prompted

### Changed
- `sync_guides()` now returns 5-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing, modified)`
  - `modified`: files with user edits detected but not yet acted on (caller decides)
  - `--force` moves modified files directly to `updated` list after creating backup
- `update` output now shows "Updated (backed up):" label when `--force` is used
- Test suite expanded to 59 tests with `test_sync_guides_force_overwrites_modified_with_backup`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-25

  - Missing files are always created, even if version numbers match

### Fixed
- **Critical bug**: `update` command incorrectly reported "all guides are up to date" when files were missing
- **Critical bug**: `update` command didn't detect user modifications to guide files
- `sync_guides()` now returns 4-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing)` instead of 3-tuple

### Changed
