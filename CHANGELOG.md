# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.18] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`go.md` is no longer gitignored** — agentic LLMs that respect gitignore patterns couldn't read the rendered entry point, breaking the entire workflow. The file is now tracked in git, which also gives mode switches a useful git history footprint.
- **Mode heading bug** — planning mode templates rendered `# concept.md — {{ project_name }}` (with the literal Jinja2 placeholder, since `project_name` was never defined). Replaced with a single mode heading in `_header-common.md` that uses actual metadata: `# {{ mode_name }} mode ({{ sequence_or_cycle }})` followed by a `> {{ mode_info }}` blockquote.

### Changed
- `_ensure_gitignore_entry()` no longer adds `go.md` to `.gitignore` (only `*.bak.*` patterns remain)
- All 14 mode templates stripped of their individual H1 headings in favor of the centralized mode heading from `_header-common.md`

## [2.0.17] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Renamed `project_setup` mode to `project_scaffold`** — "setup" was too generic; "scaffold" matches the mode's actual purpose (creating project files) and industry conventions. Breaking change for anyone using `project-guide mode project_setup`.
- Renamed template file: `project-setup-mode.md` → `project-scaffold-mode.md`
- Slimmed down `docs/site/user-guide/workflow.md` from 376 lines to ~85 lines, removing duplication with getting-started, commands, and overrides pages

### Added
- `docs/site/user-guide/modes.md` — comprehensive reference for all 15 modes with type, prerequisites, artifacts, and Mode Flow diagram
- "When to Switch Modes" table and "The HITLoop Cycle" section in workflow guide

## [2.0.13] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- `status` command redesigned with grouped sections: Mode (with prerequisites), Guide, Files — each with contextual action prompts
- File sync now uses content hash comparison instead of version comparison — a version bump no longer marks unchanged files as stale
- `(installed: vX.X.X)` only shown in status when it differs from package version
- Prerequisites line omitted when the mode has none
- Renamed `go-project-guide.md` → `go.md` — shorter, easier to autocomplete

### Removed
- Version-based file freshness check — `compare_versions` no longer used by `status` or `sync_files`

## [2.0.12] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- `status` command redesigned: compact summary by default, per-file list only when problems exist
- Status header now shows `Target:` directory, mode on one line with description
- Added `--verbose` / `-v` flag to force full per-file list
- Status footer shows `Run 'project-guide mode' to see available modes.`
- Renamed "guides" to "files" throughout: the sync system tracks files, not guides
  - `--guides` CLI flag → `--files`
  - `GuideNotFoundError` → `ProjectFileNotFoundError`
  - `GuideOverride` → `FileOverride`
  - sync.py: `get_all_guide_names` → `get_all_file_names`, `copy_guide` → `copy_file`, `backup_guide` → `backup_file`, `apply_guide_update` → `apply_file_update`, `sync_guides` → `sync_files`
  - All user-facing strings updated

## [2.0.11] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Rendered `go-project-guide.md` now outputs to `docs/project-guide/` instead of `docs/specs/` — it's mode instructions, not a spec artifact
- Entry point template moved from `project-guide/go-project-guide.md` to `project-guide/templates/go-project-guide.md`
- Jinja2 loader simplified to search only the `templates/` subdirectory
- Developer instruction in `_header-common.md` updated to `Read docs/project-guide/go-project-guide.md`
- `.gitignore` entry updated to `docs/project-guide/go-project-guide.md`
- `target_dir` now available as a Jinja2 context variable in templates

## [2.0.10] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- `init` now starts in `default` mode instead of `plan_concept`
- `files_exist` prerequisites no longer include template paths that resolve to repo-internal locations; only user-created spec artifacts are checked

### Changed
- Renamed metadata file from `project-guide-metadata.yml` to `.metadata.yml` (hidden, shorter — already scoped by `project-guide/` directory)
- Added `metadata_file` field to `.project-guide.yml` config — CLI reads the metadata filename from config instead of hardcoding it
- Render errors now show actionable guidance: run `project-guide status` and `project-guide update`
- `sync.py` guide discovery now includes dotfiles (`.*.yml` pattern)

### Added
- Parametrized test that renders every mode from the bundled metadata — proves a fresh install works and catches regressions

## [2.0.9] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- New `refactor_plan` cycle mode — migrate planning artifacts (concept, features, tech-spec) to v2.x artifact template format
- New `refactor_document` cycle mode — migrate documentation artifacts (descriptions, landing page, MkDocs) to v2.x format
- v1.x → v2.x migration notice in `status` command when config version is "1.0" or target_dir is "docs/guides"

## [2.0.8] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- New `project_setup` mode -- one-time project scaffolding (LICENSE, copyright headers, package manifest, README with badges, CHANGELOG, .gitignore)
- `project-setup-mode.md` template with step-by-step setup instructions and approval checklist

### Changed
- `default-mode.md` slimmed to pure navigation -- project lifecycle overview with mode table, no setup instructions
- Mode flow updated: `default` -> `project_setup` -> `plan_concept` -> ... -> `code_velocity`
- `project_setup` added to `project-guide-metadata.yml` between `default` and `plan_concept`

## [2.0.7] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- 5 new tests for `mode` command (no config, list modes, invalid name, config update, render output)

- Test coverage increased from 90% to 92% (112 tests, up from 107)

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- `default-mode.md` rewritten as a full project lifecycle overview (setup, planning, implementation) with links to specific modes -- serves as a friendly starting point for new users
- Distributed prerequisites from old default mode into appropriate planning modes:
  - Project idea -> `plan-concept-mode.md`
  - License preference, target audience, constraints -> `plan-features-mode.md`
  - Language/runtime, preferred frameworks -> `plan-tech-spec-mode.md`
- Added `default` mode to `project-guide-metadata.yml`

### Removed

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Brand descriptions artifact template (`templates/artifacts/brand-descriptions.md`)

### Fixed
- Renamed `brand-mode.md` to `document-brand-mode.md` and `document-mode.md` to `document-landing-mode.md` to match metadata definitions
- Added missing `mode_template` field to `document_landing` mode in metadata
- Escaped GitHub Actions `${{ }}` syntax in `document-landing-mode.md` to prevent Jinja2 conflict
- Converted `{info}` / `{description}` placeholders in brand mode to Jinja2 `{{ mode_info }}` / `{{ mode_description }}`

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Complete `code-velocity-mode.md` -- velocity coding workflow with cycle steps, practices, and mode switching guidance

- `debug-mode.md` already complete from prior work (retained as-is)
- All cycle mode templates include `{% include "modes/_header-cycle.md" %}`

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Artifact templates: `features.md`, `tech-spec.md`, `stories.md`
- All mode templates now include appropriate header partials (`_header-sequence.md` or `_header-cycle.md`)

### Fixed
- Entry point template renamed to `go-project-guide.md.j2` to prevent rendered output from overwriting the Jinja2 source template
- Explicit `encoding="utf-8"` in Jinja2 `FileSystemLoader` and `write_text()` to fix Windows cp1252 corruption of em-dash characters

### Changed
- Monolithic Steps 0-4 content removed from `go-project-guide.md.j2` — entry point is now a thin shell (header + mode include)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- `update` command re-renders `go-project-guide.md` after syncing template files that affect the rendered output
- Override/unoverride work on template-relative paths (e.g., `templates/modes/plan-concept-mode.md`)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- `status` command now shows current mode name, description, guide path, and prerequisite status before guide sync details
- Windows cross-platform fix: guide names in `sync.py` always use forward slashes via `as_posix()`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Mode-driven template system** — `project-guide mode <name>` sets the active development mode and renders `go-project-guide.md` via Jinja2
- New `mode` CLI command: set mode with argument, list available modes without argument

### Changed
- **Renamed config file from `.project-guides.yml` to `.project-guide.yml`**
  - All CLI commands now read and write `.project-guide.yml`

  - The old `project-guides` entry point will be removed in v1.5.0

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Prompt before overwriting user-modified guides**
  - `update` command now prompts `Overwrite <guide>? [y/N]` for each modified file
  - User can accept or decline per-file — declined files are reported as skipped
  - `--force` flag skips the prompt, creates a `.bak` backup, and overwrites automatically
  - `--dry-run` shows modified files with a note that they would be prompted

### Changed
- `sync_guides()` now returns 5-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing, modified)`
  - `modified`: files with user edits detected but not yet acted on (caller decides)
  - `--force` moves modified files directly to `updated` list after creating backup
- `update` output now shows "Updated (backed up):" label when `--force` is used
- Test suite expanded to 59 tests with `test_sync_guides_force_overwrites_modified_with_backup`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-25

- **Missing file detection** in `update` command
  - Missing files are now properly detected and reported separately
  - `update` command displays missing files in cyan with "+" indicator
  - Missing files are always created, even if version numbers match

### Fixed
- **Critical bug**: `update` command incorrectly reported "all guides are up to date" when files were missing
- **Critical bug**: `update` command didn't detect user modifications to guide files
- `sync_guides()` now returns 4-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing)` instead of 3-tuple

### Changed
