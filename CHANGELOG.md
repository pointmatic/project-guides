## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Reserved `project-guide` package name on PyPI**
  - Added `project-guide` as a second CLI entry point (maps to the same `project_guides.cli:main`)
  - Both `project-guides` and `project-guide` commands work identically
  - Existing users are unaffected; new users should install `project-guide`
  - The old `project-guides` entry point will be removed in v1.5.0

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Prompt before overwriting user-modified guides**
  - `update` command now prompts `Overwrite <guide>? [y/N]` for each modified file
  - User can accept or decline per-file — declined files are reported as skipped
  - `--force` flag skips the prompt, creates a `.bak` backup, and overwrites automatically
  - `--dry-run` shows modified files with a note that they would be prompted

### Changed
- `sync_guides()` now returns 5-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing, modified)`
  - `modified`: files with user edits detected but not yet acted on (caller decides)
  - `--force` moves modified files directly to `updated` list after creating backup
- `update` output now shows "Updated (backed up):" label when `--force` is used
- Test suite expanded to 59 tests with `test_sync_guides_force_overwrites_modified_with_backup`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Content-based change detection** in `update` command
  - New `file_matches_template()` function uses SHA-256 hash to compare file content with templates
  - Detects user modifications even when version numbers match
  - `status` command now shows "(modified)" for files with user edits
- **Missing file detection** in `update` command
  - Missing files are now properly detected and reported separately
  - `update` command displays missing files in cyan with "+" indicator
  - Missing files are always created, even if version numbers match

### Fixed
- **Critical bug**: `update` command incorrectly reported "all guides are up to date" when files were missing
- **Critical bug**: `update` command didn't detect user modifications to guide files
- `sync_guides()` now returns 4-tuple `(updated, skipped, current, missing)` instead of 3-tuple

### Changed
- Enhanced `status` command output to differentiate between:
  - Outdated version: "(update available)"
  - User modifications: "(modified)"
  - Missing files: "(missing)"
- Test suite expanded from 53 to 58 tests with 5 new comprehensive tests

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-10

## [1.2.6] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
