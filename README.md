A Python CLI tool that installs, swaps, and synchronizes battle-tested LLM workflow prompts across projects, supporting version tracking and project-specific overrides to keep documentation consistent while preserving customizations.

## Why project-guide?

The `go-project-guide` prompt provides the LLM with a structured workflow:
- Adapts for your current development mode (plan, code, debug, etc.) 
- Lets you stay in charge: guiding features, flow, and taste
- Handles the typing so you can stay focused on the big picture

### How It Works
- Install project-guide in any repository
- Initialize the Project-Guide system. 
- (optional) Set the project mode (plan, code, debug, etc.) 
- Tell your LLM to read the `go-project-guide.md` (in your IDE, or however you prefer).

### Human-in-the-Loop Development

This is "HITLoop" (human-in-the-loop) development: you direct, the LLM executes—It is not vibe-coding. Instead you are following the development closely and interactively guiding and improving the flow. The pace is "flaming agile"—an entire production-ready backend can be completed in 6-12 hours. 

### Customization and Updates

When you customize a prompt for your project, mark it as overridden so future package updates skip it. When you want the latest workflow improvements, run `project-guide update` to sync all non-overridden prompts. 

## Key Features
- 📚 **Battle-Tested Workflows** - Crafted workflow prompts from concept through production release in one place
- **Adaptive** — Switch project between plan, code, and debug modes to get the right instructions for each task
- 🔄 **Version Management** - Track and update all prompt docs in a project with a single command
- 🔒 **Custom Doc Lock** - Lock customized prompts to prevent update overwrites
- **Gentle Force Updates** — Automatic `.bak` files created if you `--force` update a custom prompt document
- 🎨 **CLI Interface** - Eight intuitive commands for all operations
- 🧪 **Well Tested** - 82% test coverage with 59 comprehensive tests
- ⚡ **Zero Configuration** - Works with sensible defaults out of the box
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform** - Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows with Python 3.11+

## Installation

### Via pip

```bash
pip install project-guide
```

### Via pipx (recommended for CLI coding tools)

```bash
pipx install project-guide
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize guides in your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
project-guide init
```

This creates:
- `.project-guide.yml` - Configuration file
- `docs/guides/` - Directory with guide templates

### 2. Check guide status

```bash
project-guide status
```

Output:
```
project-guide v1.5.1 (installed: v1.2.7)

Guides status:
  ⚠ README.md                                v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ best-practices-guide.md                  v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ debug-guide.md                           v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ descriptions-guide.md                    v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ developer/codecov-setup-guide.md         v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ developer/production-mode.md             v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ documentation-setup-guide.md             v1.2.7  (update available)
  ⚠ project-guide.md                         v1.2.7  (update available)

8 updates available
```

### 3. Warm-up the LLM context

In your LLM chat, type the following: 
```
Read `@go-project-guide.md`
```

This will warm up the LLM context with the instructions for the workflow. When it is ready, it will let you know what the next step is, and you just need to type this:

```
go
```

### 4. Update to latest version

Occasionally, we will update the project-guide prompt templates or add new features. You'll need to first update the Python package, then update the system or prompt templates. 

```bash
pip install --upgrade project-guide
project-guide update
```

Overridden guides are skipped by default. Modified guides prompt "Backup and overwrite?" — a `.bak` file is always created before any overwrite. Use `--force` to skip the prompt and overwrite all modified guides automatically (backups still created).

Output:
```
Updated:
  ✓ README.md
  ✓ best-practices-guide.md
  ✓ debug-guide.md
  ✓ descriptions-guide.md
  ✓ developer/codecov-setup-guide.md
  ✓ developer/production-mode.md
  ✓ documentation-setup-guide.md
  ✓ project-guide.md

✓ Successfully updated 8 guides.
```

### 5. Customize a guide (optional)

```bash
project-guide override debug-guide.md "Custom debugging workflow for this project"
```

## Command Reference

### `init`

Initialize project-guide in the current directory.

```bash
project-guide init [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--target-dir PATH` - Directory for guides (default: `docs/guides`)
- `--force` - Overwrite existing configuration

**Examples:**
```bash
# Initialize with default settings
project-guide init

# Use custom directory
project-guide init --target-dir documentation/workflows

# Force reinitialize
project-guide init --force
```

### `status`

Show status of all installed guides.

```bash
project-guide status
```

**Output includes:**
- Current package version
- Installed version in project
- Status of each guide (current, outdated, overridden, missing)
- Override reasons

### `update`

Update guides to the latest version.

```bash
project-guide update [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--guides NAME` - Update specific guides only (repeatable)
- `--force` - Update even overridden guides (creates backups)
- `--dry-run` - Show what would change without applying

**Examples:**
```bash
# Update all guides (skips overridden)
project-guide update

# Update specific guides
project-guide update --guides project-guide.md --guides debug-guide.md

# Force update all (creates backups for overridden)
project-guide update --force

# Preview changes
project-guide update --dry-run
```

### `override`

Mark a guide as customized to prevent automatic updates.

```bash
project-guide override GUIDE_NAME REASON
```

**Arguments:**
- `GUIDE_NAME` - Name of the guide file
- `REASON` - Why this guide is customized

**Example:**
```bash
project-guide override debug-guide.md "Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools"
```

### `unoverride`

Remove override status from a guide.

```bash
project-guide unoverride GUIDE_NAME
```

**Example:**
```bash
project-guide unoverride debug-guide.md
```

### `overrides`

List all overridden guides.

```bash
project-guide overrides
```

**Output:**
```
Overridden guides:

debug-guide.md
  Reason: Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools
  Since: v0.12.0
  Last updated: 2026-03-03
```

### `purge`

Remove all project-guide files from the current project.

```bash
project-guide purge [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompt

**Examples:**
```bash
# Purge with confirmation prompt
project-guide purge

# Purge without confirmation
project-guide purge --force
```

**What gets removed:**
- `.project-guide.yml` configuration file
- Guides directory (e.g., `docs/guides/`) and all contents

**Warning:** This action cannot be undone. Use with caution.

## Configuration

The `.project-guide.yml` file stores project configuration:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
installed_version: "1.1.2"
target_dir: "docs/guides"
overrides:
  debug-guide.md:
    reason: "Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools"
    locked_version: "1.0.0"
    last_updated: "2026-03-09"
```

**Fields:**
- `version` - Config file format version
- `installed_version` - Version of guides currently installed
- `target_dir` - Where guides are stored
- `overrides` - Map of customized guides with metadata

## Available Guides

## Troubleshooting

### "Configuration file not found"

**Problem:** Running commands outside a project-guide initialized directory.

**Solution:**
```bash
project-guide init
```

### "Guide already exists"

**Problem:** Trying to initialize when guides already exist.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use --force to overwrite
project-guide init --force

# Or manually remove existing guides
rm -rf docs/guides .project-guide.yml
project-guide init
```

### "Permission denied"

**Problem:** Insufficient permissions to write files.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check directory permissions
ls -la docs/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R u+w docs/
```

### Updates not appearing

**Problem:** Guides show as current but you expect updates.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if guide is overridden
project-guide overrides

# Force update if needed
project-guide update --force
```
