A Python CLI tool that installs, renders, and synchronizes battle-tested LLM workflow prompts across projects using mode-driven Jinja2 templates, with content-hash sync and project-specific overrides to keep documentation consistent while preserving customizations.

## Why project-guide?

The `go.md` prompt provides the LLM with a structured workflow:
- Adapts for your current development mode (plan, code, debug, document, refactor)
- Lets you stay in charge: guiding features, flow, and taste
- Handles the typing so you can stay focused on the big picture

### How It Works
- Install project-guide in any repository
- Initialize the Project-Guide system
- (optional) Set the project mode (plan, code, debug, etc.)
- Tell your LLM to read `docs/project-guide/go.md` (in your IDE, or however you prefer)

### Human-in-the-Loop Development

This is "HITLoop" (human-in-the-loop) development: you direct, the LLM executes--it is not vibe-coding. Instead you are following the development closely and interactively guiding and improving the flow. The pace is "flaming agile"--an entire production-ready backend can be completed in 6-12 hours.

### Customization and Updates

When you customize a file for your project, mark it as overridden so future package updates skip it. When you want the latest workflow improvements, run `project-guide update` to sync all non-overridden files.

## Key Features
- **Battle-Tested Workflows** - Crafted workflow prompts from concept through production release in one place
- **Mode-Driven Templates** - 16 modes rendered via Jinja2 so `go.md` always matches your current task
- **Content-Hash Sync** - SHA-256 hash comparison detects changes without relying on version numbers
- **Custom File Lock** - Lock customized files to prevent update overwrites
- **Gentle Force Updates** - Automatic `.bak` files created if you `--force` update a custom file
- **CLI Interface** - Nine intuitive commands for all operations
- **Shell Completion** - Tab completion for commands, flags, and mode names (bash, zsh, fish)
- **Well Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage across CLI, rendering, and action modules
- **Zero Configuration** - Works with sensible defaults out of the box
- **Cross-Platform** - Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows with Python 3.11+

## Installation

### Via pip

```bash
pip install project-guide
```

### Via pipx (recommended for CLI coding tools)

```bash
pipx install project-guide
```

### Dependencies

click, jinja2, pyyaml, packaging

### Shell Completion (Optional)

Enable Tab completion for commands, flags, and mode names. Add to your shell startup file:

```bash
# bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=bash_source project-guide)"

# zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(_PROJECT_GUIDE_COMPLETE=zsh_source project-guide)"
```

See [Installation Options](https://pointmatic.github.io/project-guide/user-guide/install-options/#shell-completion-optional) for fish and full details.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize in your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
project-guide init
```

This creates:
- `.project-guide.yml` - Configuration file
- `docs/project-guide/` - Mode templates, artifact templates, and metadata
- `docs/project-guide/go.md` - Rendered LLM instructions (default mode)

The rendered `go.md` and `.bak.*` backup files are gitignored.

### 2. Tell your LLM to read the guide

```
Read docs/project-guide/go.md
```

The LLM follows the instructions, asks clarifying questions, and generates artifacts. Type `go` to advance through steps.

### 3. Switch modes as you progress

```bash
project-guide mode plan_concept      # Define problem & solution
project-guide mode plan_features     # Define requirements
project-guide mode plan_tech_spec    # Define architecture
project-guide mode plan_stories      # Break into stories
project-guide mode plan_phase        # Add a new phase to stories
project-guide mode scaffold_project  # Scaffold license, manifest, README, CHANGELOG
project-guide mode code_direct       # Implement stories fast
project-guide mode code_test_first   # TDD red-green-refactor
project-guide mode debug             # Debug with test-first approach
project-guide mode archive_stories   # Archive completed stories.md before next phase
project-guide mode document_brand    # Brand descriptions
project-guide mode document_landing  # GitHub Pages + MkDocs docs
project-guide mode refactor_plan     # Plan a refactor
project-guide mode refactor_document # Document a refactor
```

Each mode re-renders `docs/project-guide/go.md` with focused instructions for that workflow.

### 4. List available modes

```bash
project-guide mode
```

Output:
```
Current mode: plan_concept

Available modes:
  -> default                   Getting started -- full project lifecycle overview
     plan_concept              Generate a high-level concept (problem and solution space)
     plan_features             Generate feature requirements (what the project does)
     plan_tech_spec            Generate a technical specification prompt (how it's built)
     plan_stories              Generate a user stories prompt
     plan_phase                Add a new phase to stories
     code_direct               Generate code with velocity
     code_test_first           Generate code with a test-first approach
     debug                     Debug code with a test-first approach
     document_brand            Generate brand descriptions
     document_landing          Generate landing page and docs
     refactor_plan             Plan a refactor
     refactor_document         Document a refactor
     ...
```

### 5. Update files

```bash
pip install --upgrade project-guide
project-guide update
```

Overridden files are skipped. Modified files prompt for confirmation. Backups are always created before overwrites.

### 6. Customize a file (optional)

```bash
project-guide override templates/modes/debug-mode.md "Custom debugging for this project"
```

## Command Reference

### `init`

Initialize project-guide in the current directory. Safe to run unattended — re-running on an already-initialized project is a silent exit-0 no-op, and the `--no-input` flag (plus auto-detection) ensures CI runners and post-hooks never hang on stdin.

```bash
project-guide init [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--target-dir PATH` - Directory for templates (default: `docs/project-guide`)
- `--force` - Overwrite existing configuration
- `--no-input` - Do not read from stdin; use defaults where sensible. Fail loudly if any prompt has no default. (Also auto-enabled by `CI=1` or non-TTY stdin.)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Initialize with default settings
project-guide init

# Use custom directory
project-guide init --target-dir documentation/workflows

# Force reinitialize
project-guide init --force
```

#### Unattended / CI use

`project-guide init` is safe to invoke from any unattended context (CI runners, `pyve` post-hooks, subprocess pipelines, shell scripts). Four independent triggers all enable skip-input mode, in priority order — the first match wins:

```bash
# 1. Explicit flag
project-guide init --no-input

# 2. PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT env var (truthy: 1, true, yes, on — case-insensitive)
PROJECT_GUIDE_NO_INPUT=1 project-guide init

# 3. CI env var (auto-detected on most CI runners)
CI=1 project-guide init

# 4. Non-TTY stdin (piped input, subprocess, closed stdin)
echo "" | project-guide init
```

**Idempotent re-run:** Running `project-guide init` a second time on a project that is already initialized is a silent exit-0 no-op (with an informational message). Use `--force` to re-run the full install and overwrite existing files. This makes the command safe to call unconditionally from automated flows.

### `mode`

Set or show the active development mode.

```bash
project-guide mode [MODE_NAME]
```

**Without argument:** Lists current mode and all available modes.

**With argument:** Switches to the specified mode and re-renders `go.md`.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Show current mode and list all modes
project-guide mode

# Switch to direct coding mode
project-guide mode code_direct

# Switch to debugging mode
project-guide mode debug
```

### `archive-stories`

Archive `docs/specs/stories.md` and re-render a fresh one for the next phase. Wraps the deterministic `archive` action declared on the `archive_stories` mode.

```bash
project-guide archive-stories
```

This command:

1. Reads the latest version from the highest `### Story X.y: vN.N.N` heading in `stories.md`.
2. Detects the highest `## Phase <Letter>:` heading (informational only).
3. Extracts the `## Future` section verbatim if present.
4. Moves `stories.md` to `<spec_artifacts_path>/.archive/stories-vX.Y.Z.md`.
5. Re-renders a fresh empty `stories.md` from the bundled artifact template, carrying the `## Future` section over.

If any pre-check fails (no versioned stories, archive target already exists, source file missing) the command errors and leaves the workspace untouched. If the re-render fails after the move, the source is rolled back from `.archive/`.

This command is intended to be run by the LLM after the developer has approved the archive in `project-guide mode archive_stories`.

### `status`

Show status of all installed files and current mode. Output is compact and grouped into Mode, Guide, and Files sections with color.

```bash
project-guide status [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--verbose` / `-v` - Show detailed file-level information

**Output includes:**
- Current package version and installed version
- Active mode
- Status of the rendered guide
- Status of each file (current, outdated, overridden, missing)
- Override reasons (in verbose mode)

### `update`

Update files to the latest version. Uses SHA-256 content hash comparison to detect changes.

```bash
project-guide update [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--files NAME` - Update specific files only (repeatable)
- `--force` - Update even overridden files (creates backups)
- `--dry-run` - Show what would change without applying

**Examples:**
```bash
# Update all files (skips overridden)
project-guide update

# Update specific files
project-guide update --files templates/modes/debug-mode.md

# Force update all (creates backups for overridden)
project-guide update --force

# Preview changes
project-guide update --dry-run
```

### `override`

Mark a file as customized to prevent automatic updates.

```bash
project-guide override FILE_NAME REASON
```

**Arguments:**
- `FILE_NAME` - Name of the file (positional)
- `REASON` - Why this file is customized (positional)

**Example:**
```bash
project-guide override templates/modes/debug-mode.md "Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools"
```

### `unoverride`

Remove override status from a file.

```bash
project-guide unoverride FILE_NAME
```

**Arguments:**
- `FILE_NAME` - Name of the file (positional)

**Example:**
```bash
project-guide unoverride templates/modes/debug-mode.md
```

### `overrides`

List all overridden files.

```bash
project-guide overrides
```

**Output:**
```
Overridden files:

templates/modes/debug-mode.md
  Reason: Custom debugging workflow with project-specific tools
  Since: v2.0.0
  Last updated: 2026-03-03
```

### `purge`

Remove all project-guide files from the current project.

```bash
project-guide purge [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompt

**Examples:**
```bash
# Purge with confirmation prompt
project-guide purge

# Purge without confirmation
project-guide purge --force
```

**What gets removed:**
- `.project-guide.yml` configuration file
- Target directory (e.g., `docs/project-guide/`) and all contents

**Warning:** This action cannot be undone. Use with caution.

## Configuration

The `.project-guide.yml` file stores project configuration:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
installed_version: "2.0.15"
target_dir: "docs/project-guide"
metadata_file: ".metadata.yml"
current_mode: "code_direct"
overrides:
  templates/modes/debug-mode.md:
    reason: "Custom debugging workflow for this project"
    locked_version: "2.0.0"
    last_updated: "2026-04-07"
```

**Fields:**
- `version` - Config file format version
- `installed_version` - Version of files currently installed
- `target_dir` - Where templates are stored
- `metadata_file` - Hidden metadata file inside target dir (default: `.metadata.yml`)
- `current_mode` - Active development mode
- `overrides` - Map of customized files with metadata

## Troubleshooting

### "Configuration file not found"

**Problem:** Running commands outside a project-guide initialized directory.

**Solution:**
```bash
project-guide init
```

### "File already exists"

**Problem:** Trying to initialize when files already exist.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use --force to overwrite
project-guide init --force

# Or manually remove existing files
rm -rf docs/project-guide .project-guide.yml
project-guide init
```

### "Permission denied"

**Problem:** Insufficient permissions to write files.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check directory permissions
ls -la docs/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R u+w docs/
```

### Updates not appearing

**Problem:** Files show as current but you expect updates.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if file is overridden
project-guide overrides

# Force update if needed
project-guide update --force
```
