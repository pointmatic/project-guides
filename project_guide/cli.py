    """Warn (stderr, non-fatal) when a project-local install coexists with pyve.

    Story Q.m introduced this as an *unconditional* ``pip uninstall`` warning the
    moment a project-local install was detected under a pyve-managed host. Story
    Q.q (Subphase Q-4) makes it **readiness-gated and non-destructive**: removal
    is advised only when a runnable global replacement is confirmed.

    Detection (preserved gates): the running package lives under ``Path.cwd()``
    **and** inside a ``site-packages`` directory (a real installed copy, not an
    editable source checkout — the dogfood repo's case). Silent under the
    recursion guard env var and under ``--no-input`` / CI / non-TTY stdin.

    The Q.m ``config.pyve_version`` cached gate is **dropped** in favor of a
    **live** ``shutil.which("pyve")`` check (documented exception to the Q-3
    "detection is cached" invariant), so a pyve installed *after*
    ``project-guide init`` is still detected. When pyve is absent this is
    standalone usage — no warning.

    With pyve present, ``pyve self provision --status --json`` is consulted:

    - **exit 0** (global ready & runnable) → benign-duplicate notice; removal is
      now safe, so the copyable ``pip uninstall`` command is emitted. The version
      is read from the JSON payload, with a version-less fallback on parse failure.
    - **exit 2** (not pyve-managed here) → silent.
    - **exit 1 / 127 / OSError / any other** → readiness-first guidance that
      **never** advises removal (the data-loss-class footgun this subphase closes).

    Core invariant: ``pip uninstall`` advice is emitted **only** on exit 0.

    When ``offer_provision`` is set (the ``heal`` command, not the pre-invoke
    auto-hook) and we are in the readiness-first branch, an interactive offer to
    delegate to ``pyve self provision`` is presented. The offer is naturally
    suppressed under ``should_skip_input`` (the early-return gate above).

    ``already_warned`` (Story R.h.1) suppresses the *warning text* while leaving
    the offer intact. ``heal`` needs it because the pre-invoke hook has already
    run this function a moment earlier — the hook fires ahead of every
    subcommand, ``heal`` included — so without it the user sees the same
    warning twice. The offer cannot simply move to the hook instead: prompting
    on every invocation is exactly what the Q-4 heal-scoping avoids.

    committed, then shells out to gitbetter's `git-push` to perform the
    actual push. Optional `BRANCH_NAME` passes through to gitbetter for
    branch-aware push flows.

    \b
    [Done] stories whose body contains no `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checklist items
    are treated as decorative group-overview headers (Story P.v) and filtered
    out of the uncommitted-detection flow — headers do not produce commits.

    \b
    Single uncommitted [Done] story: derives `<id>: <title>` and pushes.
    Multiple uncommitted [Done] stories: proposes a bundled subject
    `<id1>[: <ver1>], <id2>[: <ver2>], ... <title1> + <title2> + ...`
    and asks `[Y/n]`. Decline → exit 1 with the manual-resolution hint.

    \b
    Out-of-sequence detection (Story P.v) applies on `main`/`master` (or when
    the branch is undeterminable): if an uncommitted [Done] story precedes a
    committed [Done] story in stories.md document order, the wrapper flags
    it. When exactly one [Done] story is uncommitted (Story Q.p) its commit
    message is unambiguous, so the wrapper offers to commit just that story
    `[y/N]` (default N); accept → single-story push, decline → the offender
    error block + exit 1. When multiple [Done] stories are uncommitted the
    attribution is genuinely ambiguous, so the wrapper exits 1 with the
    offender block and no prompt. --no-input auto-declines.

    \b
    On any other branch (Story Q.u), squash merges to main rewrite commit
    subjects, so earlier [Done] stories may not parse from this branch's
    log even though they shipped. Instead of the out-of-sequence error, the
    wrapper announces the first committed story found in the branch and
    presumes every earlier [Done] story merged, then runs the normal flow on
    the uncommitted tail. When the branch log has no recognizable story
    commits and 2+ [Done] stories are uncommitted, it offers `Commit just
    the last one? [Y/n]` (default Y); decline (or --no-input) falls through
    to the normal bundle flow.

    \b

      - Push completed successfully

      - No `[Done]` story in stories.md
      - Out-of-sequence [Done] stories detected and not resolved: multiple
        uncommitted (Story P.v), or a single uncommitted one whose [y/N]
        opt-in commit was declined / suppressed by --no-input (Story Q.p)
      - Multiple uncommitted `[Done]` stories and bundle offer declined
        (or --no-input)
      - Duplicate story ID found in git log and continuation declined
        (or --no-input)
      - `git-push` not on PATH (install gitbetter:
        `brew install pointmatic/tap/gitbetter`)

    \b
    Heading-to-message transformation (single story):
      Input:  ### Story G.a: v1.2.3 New command `foo` with "Hello" [Done]
      Output: G.a: v1.2.3 New command 'foo' with 'Hello'
    Backticks and double quotes become single quotes; single quotes pass
    through; the colon after the story ID is preserved.

      --keep / -k  reaches gitbetter unchanged; no project-guide semantics.
      --amend      short-circuits the derivation flow entirely: reuses the

                   stories.md), refuses under --no-input, and refuses while a
                   [Done] story is uncommitted — gitbetter stages the whole
                   tree before amending, so that work would land inside the
                   previous commit under the previous commit's message.
